# rdegges-blog

This project holds all my personal blog articles, in [Markdown][markdown] format.


## Purpose

While I've historically had a single project for my blog (articles + website
code), I've decided to break the two apart by purpose: content and
presentation.

This project holds *only* my articles, in Markdown format, which allows me to
focus purely on the writing side of things, and worry about my website's look
and feel completely separately.

This also gives me the freedom to easily move my website from one backend to
another, without needing to migrate my content out of any complex systems.

Lastly, this will hopefully future-proof my writing, and give me a single place
to worry about maintaining my content in the long run.


## License

All writing is copyright (me), but feel free to use it if you'd like.


## TODO

I'm in the process of converting my posts (which have been exported from
[Posterous][posterous]) into Markdown.
