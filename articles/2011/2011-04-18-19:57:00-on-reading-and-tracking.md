# On Reading and Tracking

I've always enjoyed reading. When I was little, my mom would always read to me
and my brother before bedtime. In elementary school, I spent a lot of time
reading books on my own, and went through almost all of Stephen King's novels
(*I know, a bit heavy for an elementary schooler*). I consider myself extremely
lucky to have learned from an early age how valuable reading can be.

Over the past few years I've significantly increased the amount of reading I do
on a daily basis. I used to read around a book-per-month, but I've gradually
increased my numbers to around one book-per-week, to keep up with the ever
growing amount of titles I'd like to read.

As a programmer, I naturally enjoy keeping track of things I do, reading
included. Originally the way I tracked my reading was through my [amazon][]
reviews. I would read a book, then write a review on it. This way, I'd be able
to see a trail of books I've read. However, that approach wasn't ideal, as
sometimes I'd forget to write reviews, or wait too long after reading a book to
write the review, so the material wasn't fresh in my mind.

I eventually checked out the site [GoodReads][], which is like an [IMDB][] for
books, but the interface was too clunky, and it just didn't have the appeal I
was looking for. A couple weeks ago I discovered my new favorite book-tracking
site, [ShelfLuv][].

I saw ShelfLuv posted to [HackerNews][]; the creator was trying to get some
feedback. I signed up--and holy shit, it's awesome. It's a visual bookshelf that
lets you easily keep track of all your books, and display / recommend / store
them in a friendly way for others to see. It supports friending, and following
other people who have similar taste in books, and has a pretty decent status
feed similar to [twitter][]. I've been using it for a few weeks now, and
couldn't be happier.

Just a few things I love about the site:

-   Books on your 'bookshelf' are displayed in a pretty way. You see the book
    covers, and can get lots of other informatoin about books by navigating
    through the interface.
-   You can break up your bookshelf into multiple sections, eg: Technical,
    Business, Fiction, etc.
-   The friend system works great. It recommends people who have similar taste
    in books, and makes finding good books easy.
-   The entire interface is backed by amazon. If you want to buy a book that is
    on someone's shelf, you simply click the buy link, and are directed to
    amazon. I really like this approach, because amazon is my de-facto choice
    for purchasing books (and pretty much everything else). It's convenient.
-   You get all sorts of statistics about your books. How many you've read, how
    many you own, which ones you recommend to others, what ratings you give to
    any book (on a 5-star scale).

Overall, the entire site just kicks ass, and I'll continue using it. If you
aren't a member of [ShelfLuv][] yet, I suggest checking it out. And of course,
if you do end up joining, [follow me][] :)
