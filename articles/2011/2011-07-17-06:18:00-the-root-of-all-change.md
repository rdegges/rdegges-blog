The Root of all Change
======================

I think a lot about philosophy. One specific area that fascinates me
more and more is personal development and achievement. How do people
acheive greatness? What drives them? What separates amazing performance
from standard performance, and why is it that some people are able to
reach such unprecedented levels of success?

In my quest to continually learn more about this phenomenan, I've read
numerous books and blogs on the subject. Some of the greater ones have
been (in no particular order):

-   [Talent Is
    Overrated](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1591842948/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=projectb14ck-20&linkCode=as2&camp=217145&creative=399369&creativeASIN=1591842948 "Talent Is Overrated")

-   [The Power of
    Less](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1401309704/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=projectb14ck-20&linkCode=as2&camp=217145&creative=399369&creativeASIN=1401309704 "The Power of Less")

And this is just to name *a few*. In the past 6 months alone, I've read
well over 20 books on the topic, searching for answers and similarities
between them. I suppose you could say that my quest for knowledge has
become a bit of an obsession.

What I've come to belive after so much research is that the root of all
change is **consistency**. I've discussed this before, in various other
articles and various other manners--but at the core of all change lies
consistency. Let me explain.

In order to achieve your goals, whatever they may be, you need to change
something about yourself. Let's say you want to become the strongest man
in the world, you'll need to change your diet, training, schedule, and
many other self traits. But this is not enough on its own. Even if you
change your training schedule, it brings you no closer to your goal if
you don't *consistently* execute it.

The only way that true change can be manifested is through *consistent*
effort, over and over again. In the book, [Talent Is
Overrated](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1591842948/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=projectb14ck-20&linkCode=as2&camp=217145&creative=399369&creativeASIN=1591842948 "Talent Is Overrated"),
the author describes several scientific studies which track musicians
for long periods of time. Without exception, the best players are the
ones who *consistently* practice playing over and over again, longer
than their peers.

The conclusion the study comes to is that talent (as we know it) is
nonexistant. The only thing that separates amazing performers from
standard or sub-par performers is the amount of effort (eg:
*consistency*) they put into it. Study after study referenced in the
book draws the same conclusions. The most successful, powerful, and
top-performers in their fields always have one thing in common:
*consistency*.

So what does this mean for us? I know that for me, it means that in
order to achieve the goals I've set for myself, and to develop into the
person I someday hope to become, I need to continuously make small
changes in my daily life, and *consistently* execute them, day after
day. Of course, *consistency* is not easy to achieve. It requires
willpower, motivation, and desire. If you've ever tried to start a new
exercise or diet regiment, you likely know what I'm talking about. It
can be really, REALLY hard to make the right choices every day. For me,
everyday is a battle to continue improving, bit by bit.

When I started making my own life changes, I decided to look for ways to
get help building *consistency* into my daily routine. The best tool I
found was [habitforge](http://habitforge.com/ "habitforge") (check it
out). HabitForge is a great webapp that helps you build
*consistency*Â through habits. Their apporach is this: you create a new
habit (exercise 30 minutes a day, read for 30 minutes a day, write 1
page of text each day, etc.), and if you *consistently* execute this
habit for 21 days in a row, then you'll have overcome the psychological
hardships associated with starting a new habit (life change). HabitForge
emails you every day, asking if you completed your daily habit, and
requests your input (in yes/no format). If you answer no to any of the
daily emails, then your completion counter resets to 1 (out of 21), and
you've got to *consistently* execute your habit for another 20 days in a
row in order to 'engrain' it into your person.

The way habitforge helps you develop *consistency* in whatever you want
to do is by providing you with extra motivation: you want to see that
completion counter show that you've "mastered" a habit--so you are less
likely to avoid your task and more likely to complete it every day in a
*consistent* fashion.

I've been using habitforge for months now, and it's been a great tool.
I've used it to:

-   Lose 80lbs.
-   Read for 30 minutes a day.
-   Exercise 6 days a week.
-   Adjust my sleep schedule.
-   And other things I won't get into here.

As I continue working towards my goals, I try to constantly remind
myself that *consistency* is key. Even when you don't feel like putting
in the time towards your daily goal--do it anyway, it adds up over time.
And that is the core way to make change. *Consistency*.
