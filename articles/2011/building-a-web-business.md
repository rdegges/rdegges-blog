### Building a Web Business

June 14 2011, 5:41 PM  by Randall Degges

I've been really interested in all sorts of technology solutons and businesses
for the past year. I've read tons of books on lean startups, agile business, and
everything in between. I've also watched closely as lots of new companies have
started this year, and decided to fully document their startup experience--
planning, brainstorming, development, advertising, etc.

One of my goals for this year (to finish by January 1, 2012) is to launch some
sort of paid web service, and after procrastinating on this goal for quite some
time (I can't belive the year is almost half over), I'm going to give it a shot.
And what better way to hold myself accountable, and keep things exciting--then
by writing about it as I go along?

So here's what I'm going to do: from this point on, I'm going to fully document
the entire process on my site. The entire thing--from brainstorming and business
ideas, to implementation, launching, advertising, etc. The whole deal.

Be sure to check back in the coming days and weeks to get the juicy details!

    Hey, I tried to do this as well, I was going to do something as stupidly
    simple as resell hosting , or make a stack style host, and just learn about
    deploying on my own. I didn't get very far, because I ultimately couldn't
    get excited.

    Now, I'm working on a racing game. While its longer in terms of scope, its
    much easier to keep going back. and its 95% code instead of 95% business.
