### On Business Guys

September 18 2011, 5:01 PM  by Randall Degges

**Disclaimer: This post is going to be a bit different than my usual. Instead of
discussing technical or philosophical stuff, I'm going to be doing a bit of
ranting.**

Before I go any further, I'd like to clear up any misunderstandings: I'm a tech
guy. I'm currently the lead programmer at a small technical startup in the
telephony industry. I've always had technical jobs, and most of my friends are
engineers. I have met and known quite a few business and marketing guys in my
life, and feel like my opinion as a tech guy is validated by my personal
experiences. Furthermore: I'm not saying I'm right--I'm simply arguing my point
of view. Feel free to disagree with me!

Why Now?

As most of you know, I'm a pretty big fan of [Hacker News][]. I've been
extremely interested in the startup and tech community for many years, and the
topics discussed there typically hit close to heart. One of my lifelong dreams
is to build a successful technical empire, and as I feel I'm finally approaching
a level of development in my life that will allow me to start building this
empire, I've been paying closer and closer attention to relevant discussions
online. It seems as if every week the same few questions come up in one form or
another online:

-   Hi guys! I'm a business guy, and I'd like to know how to find a technical
    co-founder for my company. I've got some great ideas, and I'm awesome at
    selling things, but I'm having lots of trouble meeting technical people who
    will give me the time of day. What do I need to do?

Or...

-   Hi guys! I'm an engineer. Why do business guys continuously approach me with
    their ideas, and expect me to spend all my free time building a product for
    them for no pay?

Or my favorite...

-   Hi guys! I'm an engineer working on a startup in my free time with another
    dude who is handling the business side of things. I've been writing code for
    months now, and the product is beginning to look decent, but I feel like my
    partner isn't putting in a fair amount of work. He's been telling me that
    he's been *"working"* on getting customers, but I see nothing being done
    that I couldn't automate with a shell script. What do I do?

There have been some awesome discussions online surrounding these questions /
situations, with very heated debates on both sides of the table. Since I see the
same patterns emerge over and over again, I figured now is as good a time as any
to throw my thoughts out there into the mix, so here it goes.

Technical Guys are Fucking SMART

The kind of techies who work at startups, read Hacker News, and build side
projects on their free time are *SMART*. The amount of passion, dedication,
discipline, and time required to master technologies is astounding. Buillding
software today requires immense knowledge spread across numerous domains. Even
building the "*simplest*" of web services requires a wide array of technical
skills, that are the result of years worth of studying and practice.

The type of technical guys who can build entire products and companies in just a
few months (or less!) are the type of people who are extremely dedicated to
their craft, and are among the top tiers of professional development. As someone
who frequents Hacker News, I find it is often the case that non-technical people
assume the sort of technical people described above are abundant. This is simply
not true. In small, niche communities like Hacker News, it seems this way only
because the overall quality of members and users is extremely high in comparison
to that of the "real world", and thus gives the impression that "*most*"
engineers are amazing.

Furthermore, these awesome software developers aren't *just* good at technical
stuff--they're good at everything. The type of person who is continuously
learning, questioning, and creating things of value has extremely useful, deeply
ingrained character traits:

-   They have a desire to understand why and how things work.
-   They have a desire to solve problems in an elegant manner.
-   They have and exercise critical thinking skills in all aspects of life.
-   They think logically.
-   They realize what limitations they have, and know how to work around them.
-   They know how to create things.
-   They know where and how to get information they don't already have.

These traits are, in and of themselves, possibly the most useful skills of all.
People who exhibit those qualities are practically unstoppable. They're able to
identify problems and build solutions to those problems in an elegant manner.

What I'm trying to get at here is this: if these developers are so smart, what
is stopping them from simply learning how to incorporate a company, advertise
online, and sell stuff? The answer is: "*nothing*". These people are more than
capable of learning the necessary skills to build successful companies
completely solo. In comparison to learning the vast amounts of technical
knowledge they've already acquired--learning business and marketing concepts are
astoundingly simple in comparison.

Business Guys... Not So Much

As a non-technical business guy, your knowledge is at best extremely limited.
You're at a severe disadvantage:

1.  Engineers can easily learn what you know.
2.  Good engineers have character traits that make them likely to succeed at a
    myriad of activities, including business.
3.  Engineers understand how things work. Instead of making assumptions about
    problems, engineers \**know*\* about problems, why they exist, and how to
    solve them.
4.  Engineers know the best way to find and build solutions to problems.
5.  Engineers are more creative: their understanding of how and why things work
    gives them a large pool of creative ideas which would not be available to
    non-technical folk.

Regardless of whether you exhibit useful character traits, you are lacking the
necessary skills to build solutions to your problems. This means that you are
essentially replacable by technology.

No Incentive

What it comes down to is that technical guys really don't have any incentives to
work with business guys. Let's say that in a best-case scenario, a business guy:

-   Is passionate about the problem.
-   Wants to help customers solve this problem by selling them your solution.
-   Has a proven track record for selling to customers in this industry.
-   Is in contact with a large amount of customers who are willinng to give
    feedback on your potential solution.
-   Knows how to advertise this solution.

Ignoring the fact that this is a best-case scenario, the business guy is still
not needed by the engineer. Why?

-   The engineer must also be passionate about this problem in order to devote
    time (without pay) to working on it.
-   The engineer knows how to find customers to get feedback from. He knows that
    he can do an hour or two of research and collect this information.
-   The engineer is able to adapt his solution to the customers problem without
    a middleman. This leads to faster development, more precise solutions, and
    happier customers.
-   The engineer can easily advertise his solution in a pragmatic fashion using
    tech tools to do so: A/B testing, online marketing, buisness analytics tools
    and programs, etc.

Furthermore, the deal is not appealing to the engineer because the amount of
work he has to put into developing the actual solution far outweighs the amount
of time that is needed to do equal amounts of marketing and sales by the
business guy.

To engineers it is far more profitable and enjoyable to simply build solutions
to problems without business guys, as the engineers will have:

-   Complete ownership of the solution.
-   Deep undertsanding of the problem, and solution.
-   The skills necessary to build a solution, and maintain it over time.
-   The smarts to market, grow, and continuously evolve the solution to make it
    more successful over time.

What to Do

Although this post comes off as extremely hostile towards "business guys", that
is really not my intention. Instead, I hope to give "business guys" some true
understanding of business from a "tech guy's" perspective.

What I'd suggest business guys do, in order to develop the traits discussed in
this article, is to become a "tech guy". Learn to program. Learn how to use
linux. Build a passion for understanding how and why things work. People can
change. Even the most non-technical person in the world can use their willpower
to "retrain" themselves. While it definitely involves a lot of work and
dedication, the benefits are lifelong.

TLDR;

If you're a "business guy", instead of trying to find a "tech guy" to work with,
consider working on yourself to become a "tech guy".

    Disclaimer: I'm a business guy and tech guy, but I do think your best case
    business guy scenario describes the best case "first-time building a
    product" business guy and not the true best case business guy.

    The best case business guy has had many many many ideas and he's spent years
    talking about them and validating them. He's actually worked with others in
    companies that have built products (successes and failures both matter here
    since both are relevant experience), they have interviewed hundreds of
    potential customers for dozens of ideas. They're actively interested in
    understanding workflows, usability, human cognition, human perception,
    social dynamics. They know how to quickly define the acute pain points of
    the users. They can distinguish from merely cool features from true utility
    (personal or social). They understand design. They understand typography.
    They understand interfaces. They know how to critique. They know how to
    communicate with engineers. They know how to keep people on task. They
    eliminate noise. They're cognizant of the immense difficulty in building
    concrete systems and how distractions make doing do that much harder.
    They'll do everything possible to keep the engineers from having to worry
    about shit that isn't engineering, but will teach the engineers about those
    things when the engineers haven't learned those things yet either in a
    book/blog or via experience. Although the best case business guy may not
    have the skills to code an entire product, they have at least taught himself
    how to code enough to be able to prototype.

    The best case business guy can come to a project with a lot more than is
    given credit above. The best case business guy is teaching the tech guy all
    these things above and more so that the tech guy has less of a need for a
    business guy the next time around. The same is true for the best case tech
    guy.

    Andrew, that's completely true. I think I kinda aimed this at the sort of
    business guys who I see posting on various websites about finding technical
    co-founders, etc. Overall: non-technical people who have an interest in
    starting a company, but need technical people to make it happen.

    The sort of person you're describing in your comment is not only a business
    guy, but a very successful person overall. If a person has the ability to
    not only be a strong leader, and make life easier for the engineers, but
    also has the technical understanding and skills to prototype and start a
    product, then they would be extremely valuable to any company.

    I'm not advocating that you must be an excellent top-tier engineer to do
    business, I'm advocating for business people to learn enough technology to
    be able to understand and solve problems at a technical level, so that they
    are at least on par with (and can relate to) their technical counterparts.

    Thank you for your comment, I found it really insightful.

    I'm an engineer, but I don't code. I'm the business guy in our two-man
    startup and my cofounder does not want to deal with things that aren't close
    to his heart. Being good at things and wanting to do things are vastly
    different. That said, good tech guys have way more leverage because of the
    reasons you've brilliantly outlined.

    As a marketing guy who has spent the last several years learning about the
    technologies needed to become a tech guy I could not agree more with many of
    the insights of your post. The only point I might disagree on is the
    characterization of those who have the abilities to develop web systems as
    necessarily smart. I think dedicated and focused are much better
    descriptions of the needed traits.

    I myself am not smart but fortunately live in a time when the amount of
    resources available to anybody with an internet connection and the desire to
    learn about virtually any topic, particularly web development, is
    incredible. I would encourage any business/marketing/idea people to begin
    learning about and using web technologies. It will make it much easier for
    them to validate and refine any ideas they have from a technical perspective
    and ultimately knowing how to create a web service is a tremendous advantage
    for a person to have. All the more so if paired with domain or business
    knowledge.

    Dear Randall,\
    I totally agree...as a matter of fact, I, myself reflected on this recently.
    I reasoned as following;

    There are many examples of successfull companies founded by tech-guys, in
    fact the biggest companies around are found by techies. One might argue that
    the quantity of such companies were few in numbers earlier but at the same
    time it becomes more and more common. From Microsoft, Dell to Facebook...the
    examples are many and in my opinion the latest one is the guys behind World
    of Mincraft. Techies that made millions of dollars over a night.

    At present day, it's rather trivial for a tech-guy to launch and make money
    on his/her product. IMHO, this is a trend pointing in a clear direction...or
    what about the guy behind the game "Braid". From what I have hear - he
    created everything by himself, coding, graphich to music...all of it.

    Its more common that technical people are musical than not...many
    programmers as graphically talented as well. But the reverse is not
    necesserally true.

    Regarding bussiness-guys; the majority of people calling themselves
    bussiness guys are unfortuantelly talentless persons hoping to catch the
    wave created by the tech-person. I have come to the conclusion that one must
    do more than the talk...they must be able to DO. And this is what separates
    the bussiness men from the clowns (I know - it sounds harsh but I am
    entitled to have my own opinion :))

    Anywho...I agree and want to thank you for both your insights as well as for
    the slightly different perspective than mine.

    @Hakan Bilgin Thanks for the comment, it's interesting for me to hear what
    other people think about the topic :)

    hey, I love your blog, I'm about 23, and I feel like much of what you say
    resonates a lot, especially the journey to learning.

    Anyways,

    I totally agree that the average "craigslist-visionary" business person can
    be sort of useless to me. I spent some time reading and learning business
    and I read maybe 10 books. After this, and my natural passive interest, I
    feel pretty competent in business discussions.

    Meanwhile, I've spent 3 or 4 years learning the skills of programming (be it
    in engineering school or tutorials)from an entry level, and just now I'm
    maturing into doing game development, as I wanted to. And I'm still
    learning, of course.

    But,

    I would say that there is a business person I would look for, and this may
    just be me. If I had to hire a business person, but I could pick anyone, I
    would look for someone who is a task master, who is subordinate to me in
    terms of vision but equal in stake, and someone who manages minutia that
    happens in business. Answer the phone, make the appointments, research
    metrics, etc, etc. Someone who takes care of the BS, keeps people happy,
    etc. This is really because of how I function: I'm not always going to be
    the most responsive to emails, or punctual, and I can keep strange hours,
    but Its how I work. I need to zone in, and I don't allow much to compromise
    that. Also, someone who knows how to pitch to investors, make a good
    powerpoint, etc. These are things I can do, but I won't be a master. I
    somewhat agree with Paul Graham on the question of having a co-founder, for
    some of the same reasons.

    The biggest problem I have with business people I've worked with, is that
    they try to make technical decision, or try to introduce their opinions or
    visions for the product, which is totally unacceptable. I know and respect a
    few good business people, but they are rare.

    I'm really enjoying reading your blog Randall! I too am a passionate
    programmer and I think most A+ programmers would rather unite with other
    great programmers and have complete control of a project rather than let a
    business guy own a majority of the work and vest put into an extremely
    revolutionary tech-based startup. I guess the problem is finding other
    high-calibur programmers that are willing to work for free for an equal
    share on an idea they also like, communist programming I guess :)

    Randall:

    There is no difference between business and technology - they are both an
    exercise in logic. Your experience is similar to mine (and many others) in
    that you may have found business people who do not rigorously apply
    best-practices and results based thinking to business as you might apply to
    a particular project.

    Read the book "Lean Startup" for amazing insight into how engineers make
    great business people (the inverse of what you are saying here.) It will
    resonate with you very strongly based on your experience - and it's written
    by an engineer ("CTO").

    I have a lot more to say, but I'll cut it short:

    ​1. I love you\
    2. Would you be my technical cofounder?
