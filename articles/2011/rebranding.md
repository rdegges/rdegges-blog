### Rebranding

May 22 2011, 10:00 PM  by Randall Degges

As you may have noticed, my site has been rebranded. The old "projectb14ck" name
is gone forever. Instead of keeping projectb14ck alive, I've decided to
completely move my web presence over to match my name and personal information.
This change has been a long time coming. All URLs and stuff have been
redirected, so by the time you see this, all DNS changes should have propogated,
and everything should be working as usual. Thanks!
