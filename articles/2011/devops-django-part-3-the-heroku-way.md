### DevOps Django - Part 3 - The Heroku Way

December 18 2011, 4:15 PM  by Randall Degges

This article is part of a series I'm writing called DevOps Django, which
explains how to best deploy modern Django sites. If you're new, you should
probably read the [first article][] of the series before this one.

My Search for Solutions

In the [previous installment][] of this series, I discussed (in depth) the
problems with deploying Django as a devops guy. After struggling with deployment
for \~2 years, and finding very little relief in modern devops tools (puppet,
monit, nagios, etc.), I started looking for new solutions.

Several months ago I was reading [Hacker News][] and noticed that [Heroku][] had
recently added Python support to their platform-as-a-service stack. If you're
not familiar with Heroku, they're a very popular ployglot hosting platform.
They've been around since 2007 providing Ruby hosting, but over the past year
they've added support for multiple languages, and seem to be kicking ass and
growing like mad.

I've continuously heard their name mentioned by other programmers, but this was
the first I'd heard of them having any Python support, so I bookmarked
their [Django tutorial][] and told myself I'd give it a spin sometime.

Coincidentally, a few weeks later I was asked to give an impromptu lightning
talk during a[pyladies][] hack-a-thon, so I decided to give Heroku a spin, and
do my lightning talk on that. In a weird twist of fate, the few hours I spent
learning Heroku turned out to be some of the best invested hours of my life.

During the hack-a-thon I built and deployed a simple Django site (with celery
support) in just under an hour. If I were to build the same site and attempt to
deploy it on EC2, I'd have easily spent a week getting things deployed using
puppet, monit, nagios, etc.

After the hack-a-thon ended, I decided to play around with Heroku a bit more,
and see what the platform really had to offer other than what I used during my
short sprint.

A Second Look

Later that week, I had a few hours to kill, so I revisited Heroku's website, and
read through all their [help resources][] and tutorials. I also took an in-depth
look at their [addons][], trying to decide what their services could be used
for: personal projets, business ideas, work projects?

The first thing I was blown away to discover is that Heroku has an enormous
amount of addons. They literally have addons for almost any piece of
infrastructure you could ever
want:[PostgreSQL][], [Redis][], [cron][], [memcached][], [RabbitMQ][], [Solr][],
etc. Upon seeing this, I started to get excited.

Second, I took the opportunity to play around with their extremely easy to
install and use [CLI tool][], and was blown away again. Heroku's CLI tool gives
you complete control over your Heroku applications. You're able to create new
Heroku applications out of Git repositories, instantly provision addons for your
application (PostgreSQL, Redis, etc.), view streaming logfiles, instantly scale
up (and down) your nodes, etc. Furthermore, you're able to run shell commands
locally using their CLI tool. Need to access the Django shell? No problem, you
can simply execute \`\`**heroku run python manage.py shell**\`\` from your
terminal.

*By this point, I was really itching to use Heroku for something serious.*

While I was able to build and deploy a simple Django site on Heroku in under an
hour during the hack-a-thon, I knew that I needed to port a much larger, more
complex site over to Heroku to really see if it could meet my professional
needs.

So, I checked out a fresh copy of the teleconferencing service that I develop at
work, and got to it.

How I Ported My Work Application to Heroku

If you'd like to see details about what technologies the teleconferencing
service uses, check out the [previous part][previous installment] of this
series. As the teleconferencing service is large, complex, and infrastructure
heavy--I figured that if I could port it to Heroku then I'd be able to use
Heroku for almost anything.

The first thing I did was create a new Heroku application using their CLI tool:
\`\`**heroku create --stack cedar**\`\`, then deploy my application to Heroku
using Git: \`\`**git push heroku master**\`\`.

Secondly, I installed a few addons so I could use my required infrastructure
components (RabbitMQ, memcached, PostgreSQL, and cron):

-   \`\`**heroku addons:add rabbitmq**\`\`
-   \`\`**heroku addons:add memcache**\`\`
-   \`\`**heroku addons:add shared-database**\`\`
-   \`\`**heroku addons:add scheduler**\`\`

**NOTE**: By leaving off the size of the addons at the end, you install the
cheapest (smallest) plan for each service. By adding these addons just as I've
shown above, it adds 0\$ per month to your bill.

Next, I modified my production settings file
(\`\`**project/settings/prod.py**\`\`, in my case), to work with Heroku's hosted
RabbitMQ, memcached, and PostgreSQL services. In the end, my settings file
looked something like this:

[https://gist.github.com/1489734][]

As quick note, everytime you push code to Heroku, they automatically read your
top-level \`\`**requirements.txt**\`\` file, and install any packages you've
defined. This makes handling site dependencies completely transparent to you
(the developer). In order to get my site working on Heroku, the only change I
had to make to my requirements file was adding \`\`**django-pylibmc-sasl**\`\`,
as the Heroku memcached addon requires SASL authentication, which the commonly
used \`\`**python-memcached**\`\` library doesn't provide.

Just for clarity, here's my \`\`**requirements.txt**\`\` file:

[https://gist.github.com/1494844][]

As you can see in the settings file, Django is simply using environment
variables to interact with the various infrastructure components we added
earlier. All of Heroku's addons work by exporting one (or more) environment
variables that your application can use. This makes using Heroku addons
extremely convenient. You can reuse most of your Django settings across all your
projets, since you're storing the important stuff in environment variables. No
coupling required.

Additionally, the Heroku CLI tool also allows you to set, edit, and remove your
own environment variables. I used this functionality to set my application's
\`\`**SECRET\_KEY**\`\`, along with other arbitrary stuff (like my [Amazon
S3][] credentials, etc.). To add these environment variables to my Heroku
application, I simply ran: \`\`**heroku config:add
SECRET\_KEY=xxx AWS\_ACCESS\_KEY\_ID=xxx ...**\`\`.

The next thing I did was define a top-level file, \`\`**Procfile**\`\`, which
Heroku uses to specify the different types of 'dynos' you'll be running.
Essentially, a Procfile just lists a series of executable commands that do
stuff. Here's the Procfile I wrote:

[https://gist.github.com/1492353][]

Each line contains a reference name, followed by the command you want to run. In
my case, I've got three separate 'dyno' types: a gunicorn instance (this is my
actual Django web application), a celerybeat instance (for scheduling periodic
tasks), and a celery worker instance (for processing asynchronous tasks).

The way Heroku runs and manages your application is via these dyno types. For
instance, let's say I want to have Heroku run three 'web' instances (this is the
equivalent of running three separate web servers), I could run: \`\`**heroku
scale web=3**\`\` from the CLI, and Heroku would instantly ensure that three of
my 'web' dynos are running--automatically load balancing incoming HTTP requests
across the three.

**NOTE**: You can run \`\`**heroku ps**\`\` to see what processes (and how many
of each) are running.

After defining my \`\`**Procfile**\`\`, I just ran \`\`**heroku scale web=1
scheduler=1 worker=1**\`\`, and Heroku instantly spun up my entire cloud
infrastructure.

**INSANE**

**NOTE**: If you are running celerybeat, be sure to only run it a single time,
and no more. If you have multiple celerybeat instances running, you'll have
duplicate tasks in your queue. That's why I specifically created two separate
celery dyno types, "*scheduler*" and "*worker*", so that I could safely scale my
worker processes using: \`\`**heroku scale worker=x**\`\`, while keeping only a
single scheduler.

A Quick Recap

It took me a total of \~2 hours to:

-   Make a large website and API completely Heroku compatible.
-   Fully provision a PostgreSQL server.
-   Fully provision a memcached server.
-   Fully provision a RabbitMQ server.

And don't forget--this is the amount of time it took me while still learning
about Heroku, and reading through the documentation. I think it is fair to say
that if there were more tutorials, articles, and information available, this
process could be shortened substantially.

I'll repeat this again: that is ***INSANE***.

Compared to the time, effort, and maintenance required to setup my
teleconferencing application normally using a standard devops toolset, this was
a piece of cake. I didn't have to provision a puppet server, manage a puppet
repo, or anything.

Heroku makes deployment so easy, you don't even need a [fabfile][].

The Heroku Way

Through the process of learning, using, and eventually moving my company's
entire infrastructure over to Heroku, I learned quite a bit about Heroku's
ideals.

In my [first article][1] discussing the "*deployment problem*" in the Django
community, I said that I have a dream for the Django community; a dream that all
Django developers can build their websites with peace of mind, knowing a
production deployment is no more than 10 minutes away.

**Heroku is quickly making my dream a reality.**

The "*Heroku Way*", as I refer to it now, consists of a few simple principles:

-   Build your Django sites using standard open source tools.
-   Use Git to manage your deployment revisions.
-   Instantly provision, resize, or remove any infrastructure components you
    need.
-   Keep your private data decoupled from your codebase via environment
    variables.
-   Instantly scale your infrastructure up and down as you please.
-   Pay by usage.

After having tried numerous deployment methods myself, and after using Heroku, I
strongly believe that Heroku's approach to solving the *deployment problem* is
the right way. As a developer, using Heroku is a big win:

-   You can deploy both small and large sites the same way (and scale them as
    large as you'd like with no added complexity).
-   It's cost effective (Heroku's prices aren't much more expensive than
    Amazon's, which Heroku is built on top of). I'll go into more depth on this
    in my next article.
-   You aren't locked into anything: the same codebase you use to develop your
    site locally can be used on Heroku in a matter of minutes.

Deploying code to Heroku ***feels right***. As a developer, you shouldn't have
to spend 90% of your time writing puppet rules and working with vendor APIs to
provision servers. You shouldn't need two weeks to scale your site when you get
an influx of users.

Instead, you should be coding--which is precisely what Heroku is designed to
help you do.

In the next part of this series, I'll be detailing my decision to move from
Rackspace to Heroku. Making an infrastructure move is a big decision. In the
next article I'll discuss my reasoning with you.

**PS**: If you read this far--I'd like to ask you a question. Would you be
interested in a book about Django deployments? If so, what sort of topics would
you expect to be covered?

**UPDATE**: I've finished the next part of the series! You can read it [here][].

**UPDATE**: I also published a book on Heroku! If you'd like to check it out,
you can do so here: [http://www.theherokuhackersguide.com/][].

    Bob responded:

    Regarding Django deployments blog posts or books:

    I would love to see a basic application (even as simple as a "Hello World"
    website, from start to finish, created and deployed.

    By this, I mean that I want it to be from the perspective of the user
    knowing almost nothing. Take a .net user - knows little about Python 2 vs 3,
    virtualenv, an IDE for the desktop, git, etc.

    Get a virtual environment set up. Install on the desktop all components
    necessary to be a Python / Django developer. Toss in Pinax for good measure.
    Bring it up on the desktop. Get a git repo running, for sharing and version
    control. Then set up a Heroku account, and push it all out the Heroku.

    That's exactly what I want and need at the moment. I would pay for that
    book!\
    Heck, I'd even take a link, if someone's got that info, step-by-step (or
    screen-cast) published already.

    Randall Degges responded:

    @Bob, that sounds cool--but I think that going from 0 -\> full knowledge
    wouldn't really be appropriate for most blog posts; there's just way too
    much to cover.

    I was, however, planning on writing a post in the near future about
    developing Django / python locally, what tools to use, etc.

    In terms of a book, I was thinking something along the lines of:

    - Discuss design patterns and architecture patterns to build scalable Django
    sites.\
    - Discuss deployment options.\
    - Discuss implementation of various infrastructure components and capacity
    planning.

    What do ya think?

    Bob responded:

    I think it would be definitely worth a book chapter or a blog series to walk
    through a complete example.

    Like I said, I have a particular problem: getting a team of developers to
    move into the Python / Django development world. And I think that Heroku is
    one piece of that puzzle.

    I thought getting a simple "hello world" site up and running, in a git repo,
    with all the tools installed on the desktop, and published to Heroku, would
    be a good singular focus. It would give ONE solution that could be a
    launching point for other variations.

    I'm not suggesting that you explain anything about Django or Python Syntax
    (other than "choose Python 2.72" or whatever). I'm saying dictate the
    standards, provide the links, and walk through one example. If we follow
    these steps, then the basic Pinax project will be up and running on Heroku.
    That would be Waaaaay cool!

    Then, you can vary things as you said. Deployment options: What database
    choices? What web server? What ide choices? Why not App Engine? How do you
    optimize? What are the best practices for directory structures? etc.

    Maybe I'm thinking it'd be a good chapter 2 to your book. Walk me through an
    example.

    @Randall -- Love your dream... neat article! We've been working towards a
    similar dream, and have it down to a minute or so (using some starter apps).
    We've started off with Python/Django on Google App Engine, and have had some
    requests for adding Heroku support at some point as well. I think we now
    make the dream come true for at least some folks and some projects. Would
    love to have you try us out when you have a minute. Best wishes, - Adrian
    Scott, ceo, CoderBuddy P.S. Re Book, Discussion about patterns for
    scalability would be great, also about when to extend Django vs code stuff
    in Python is a common issue we look at, e.g. middlewares, caching.

    @Bob, Would love to have you try us out. I think we do most of what you need
    already (w/ Google App Engine as destination rather than Heroku). Please
    check us out or drop me an email (firstname at companyname . com)

    claymcclure (Twitter) responded:

    I think a book along the lines of "So I wrote my first Django app-now what?"
    would be useful to a lot of folks. Beyond deployment (which almost sounds
    like a solved problem with Heroku), it could talk about scaling, monitoring,
    maintenance, performance, security, and all the other things so often
    overlooked or misunderstood by novice web developers.

    Would you be interested in collaborating on such a project?

-   Feb 18 2012, 10:56 PM

    Randall Degges responded:

    @claymcclure Yeah--it's such a huge topic it is really difficult to
    enumerate what would need to be discussed, I think. I've actually been
    thinking about a deploying Django type book that takes a really opinionated
    stance regarding technologies.

    Stuff like:

    - Use celery for queuing.\
    - Use memcached for caching.\
    - Use postgres for db.\
    - etc...

    Then going into lots of details about various setups / options for each of
    the components, and how to make them work in production situations.

    I've been thinking about it for a while, but the idea of actually writing it
    just seems kind of daunting (there's so much stuff to cover), and I'm
    partially afraid that by the time it's written the information will be
    useless :(

    Totally open to talking more about it though, feel free to email me:
    [rdegges@gmail.com][].

    ehmatthes (Twitter) responded:

    I would like a guide that is organized around scaling. What is important to
    keep in mind when I am just developing, so that I have to change as little
    as possible when I deploy and scale? Is it okay to use sqlite in
    development, or should I go straight to a full database? How does cost rise
    as I scale a deployed app?

    For example, I am just starting to deploy a free app to heroku. How much
    will it cost if my database grows, but my usage patterns stay low? How much
    use can I see and stay with a free app? Is heroku using "app" accurately, or
    are they really talking about django "projects"?

    If I am developing a few projects, what's a good approach for keeping costs
    low or free for all projects, but quickly deploying one of the projects more
    appropriately if it starts to gain traction?

    Those are the big questions I am playing with lately. Your posts have been
    really valuable to me as a new django user. Thank you.

    I notice you're using django-cachemachine . Any challenges getting that to
    work with the pylibmc that heroku memcache requires? Django-cachemachine
    extends the built-in django-memcached backend, which is incompatible . Just
    wondering if you had to do any tweaking or if it just works. Thanks.

    Hey Ben, I had it in there, but I actually wasn't using it. There is a patch
    that craigkerstiens submitted to the cache machine project which allows it
    to work with SASL authentication, but it hasn't been accepted yet.

    If you look at their Github issue tracker, you should see it there, and you
    can apply that to fix it if you really want to use cache machine on Heroku
    :)

    Idan Zalzberg responded:

    Thanks for the post.\
    How would you handle the concurrency issues with gunicorn. As I understand
    in your configuration you can process only 3 requests in parallel.\
    Also I believe the amqplib message posting is blocking so if you trigger
    tasks on celery you are bound to get blocked pretty quickly.

    I didn't find a way to make Django/Heroku work concurrently with
    celery/RabbitMQ

-   Sep 19 2012, 11:57 AM
    Randall Degges responded:
    Hi @Idan Zalzberg, basically you tell gunicorn to use gevent mode. (gunicorn
    -k gevent). This uses the non-blocking IO approach to concurrency, allowing
    you to continue processing requests in parallel and greatly improve your
    throughput.
-   Sep 19 2012, 12:31 PM
    Idan Zalzberg responded:
    Thanks, I've tried that, but i'm not sure the default transport of the
    celery client will get patched by the gevent so it will still block. I
    couldn't find the transport that is guaranteed to work in a gevent
    environment.

    Hey Randall,

    Thanks again for the useful e-book! I already used it in getting started
    with Heroku and their Heroku Scheduler functionality.

    Wrote a blogpost on it getting it to work with custom Django management
    commands.

    Thanks again!

-   Sep 20 2012, 5:27 PM
    Randall Degges responded:
    @Idan Zalzberg I use SQS as a transport. I'm not absolutely positive it is
    being patched by gevent, but it has super low response time (monitored by
    new relic). Average queue adds take about 1ms from my Heroku instance.

    Benjamin Roberts responded:

    Randall,

    I purchased your book. Although short, I found it to be concise, and useful
    as a review for the experienced user or an introduction for someone new.
    Worth the \$10 spent.

    On a separate note, I was wondering if you have come up with a standard
    recommended setup for gunicorn that you use in your Procfiles?

    In your comment above, you appear to endorse using \`gunicorn -k gevent\`.
    But you only set it to 3 workers. Aren't the dyno processors 4-cored?
    Therefore, based on gunicorn's (2 x \$num\_cores) + 1 rule of thumb 9 would
    seem to be a good default.

    From this, and from this related blog post: \
    [http://v3.mike.tig.as/blog/2012/02/13/deploying-django-on-heroku/][]

    I have come to a (non-final) conclusion that maybe \
    using \`gunicorn -k gevent -w 9\` is a good default for heroku deployments?

-   Sep 24 2012, 4:20 PM

    Randall Degges responded:

    Hi @Benjamin Roberts. Thanks for the kind words about the book! Glad you
    like it \^\^

    In regards to your question about gunicorn, I've standardized my setup a bit
    over time (since this post was written).

    For my Django stuff, I always define a gunicorn.py.ini file (see example
    here:
    [https://github.com/rdegges/django-skel/blob/master/gunicorn.py.ini)][].
    You'll see there that I'm using 4 gunicorn workers with gevent.

    I did a bunch of load testing a while back (after writing this post), and
    realized that on virtual servers I was able to get a lot more throughput
    using the same number of gunicorn workers as virtual CPUs, in combination
    with gevent, which is why I've been doing it that way.

    Furthermore, you may find my django-skel project interesting:
    [https://github.com/rdegges/django-skel][]. It's my Heroku-ready Django
    skeleton project, pre-configured with all the basics (nothing you wouldn't
    want) and has full documentation for developers:

    Malzieu responded:

    Hi! Great article, I love this series.

    I am just wondering why you need a dedicated dyno for celerybeat: isn't that
    too much? On heroku, can't you run the celerybeat server on the same dyno as
    say, one of you worker? As far as I know, a dedicated dyno for celerybeat
    seems to be overkill?

    Thanks :)

-   Dec 22 2012, 8:21 AM

    Randall Degges responded:

    Hey @Malzieu,

    The celerybeat worker also runs celery workers as well, so the extra dyno
    will actually run all scheduled tasks, and process tasks at the same time.

    Doing it this way won't really cost you any extra, since you'd likely be
    running one web dyno and one worker dyno regardless.
