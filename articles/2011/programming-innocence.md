### Programming Innocence

January 11 2011, 10:06 PM  by Randall Degges

I've been programming for a long time. When I first started programming, I would
spend as long as I humanely could on the computer writing code. Sure, my code
sucked, but I was having fun, and I was learning a lot. Over the years, this
programming innocence left me.

The one true thing that can strip a programmer of his innocence is fear. Fear of
not knowing the best way to do things (best practices). Fear of not using the
right tools and languages. Fear of errors (especially compiler errors). Fear of
schedules. Fear of publicity (what will other programmers think about this
code?). I suspect that all programmers experience those fears in greater and
greater amounts as they become better and better.

Programming innocence is a powerful thing. When reflecting about this topic in
my head over the past week or so, I immediately began thinking of the best
programmers I know. What do I respect about them? What makes them so great? I
believe that in most cases, their greatness can be directly correlated to their
innocence. The best programmers I know are the ones who naively charge into
battle: fearlessly removing code, spending days in complete isolation getting a
prototype hacked together, ignoring all critics and outside influences. These
guys are my heroes. They code ruthlessly in order to solve their problems. They
yield for nothing.

So how can you regain your programming innocence once it has been lost?

Just Say "fuck it"

-   Found a more efficient way to write your code? Implement that shit! Don't
    make yourself worry about all you have to learn, just learn it. Code can be
    enhanced over time, so don't worry that learning new things in the future
    will waste your time now. Every time you write code, you grow.
-   Worried that your library / programming language / etc. will be outdated in
    the next few years? Don't be. Think agile. When things change, change your
    code with it.
-   Feeling stressed out by that deadline? Fuck it. You are a hacking god. If
    you stare at the computer hard enough, the code will practically write
    itself. Be confident in your abilities, and never be afraid to completely
    isolate yourself from the world, and code like an animal.
-   Do you worry what other programmers will say about your code? Don't let that
    stop you. If other people have a problem with your code, have them send you
    a pull request.

The moral is: when things bring you down, instead of letting them best you,
remain innocent. Hack your heart out every day, and don't forget that the only
thing that really matters is how much fun you have along the way.

    You are so right. I call this attitude "amateurism as a core value", and I'm
    kind of sad I sort of lost that amateur quick and dirty attitude. I still
    enjoy coding sprees and hacking shit fast and changing later, but I tend to
    try to write elegant and clean code instead of just writing code.

    Back in the days where I only cared about getting it done and then making it
    work fast and nothing more, my code sucked, but I was able to move mountains
    in a breeze.

    Thanks for voicing my sentiment.

    Nah, I like them. The errors I fear are the ones the compiler doesn't catch

    It really irony that there are 5784 views and just 6 comments. People can
    add more information to the existing article by using the comment space
    below instead of just taking a peek.

    I knew that fear stops an amateur programmer to leave his innocence and code
    more maturely. But I would like to add that there are few more like doubt
    and disbelief that hampers the growth of a programmer. If you have watched
    the movie 'The Matrix' you will know exactly what I am talking about.
    Morpheus asks Neo to free his mind by removing the 3 things fear,doubt,
    disbelief. When that happens you will do miracles and bend the laws of
    nature.

    Most of the hackers/programmers started coding when they are very young,
    mostly in their teenage years. They learned coding and practiced it for so
    long before they produced some exceptional results. For this I have to
    suggest Peter Norvig's "Teach Yourself Programming in Ten Years". I would
    suggest to have a great mentor with whom you can share your
    ignorance/innocence or whatever you may call it.

    I thought I'd leave a comment, but was immediately struck with anxieties; \
    Will I be able to spell correctly? \
    Will people think I wrote something stupid, or in a stupid way?\
    So I decided I'd better not comment.

    I like some of the advice, but there are some things that I disagree with.

    A rational fear will keep us safe from harm, but an irrational fear will
    keep us stagnant and prevent us from growing. We need to be able to
    recognize what are our rational fears and what are our irrational fears.
    You're afraid to delete that function? Why isn't your code in source
    control? You don't know how to do something? Try it some place where it
    doesn't matter.

    I agree that we have to keep trying new things, but we need to recognize
    when it is the right time to try new things. That's why we have dev, test
    and prod.

    I agree that we can't be afraid of criticism, but criticism can be good. We
    need to recognize what is constructive and when someone is just voicing
    their irrational fear. If you never receive any constructive criticism it's
    a good sign that it's time to move on to greener pastures.

    It can be very easy to forget that we are in communities of programmers and
    often times those are our best resources. Find a community that supports you
    and helps you grow. Growing in isolation is a hard task.

    In the end, you are right, it's all about how much fun you have along the
    way.

    Jeff V responded:

    Trevor hit it on the head - you can't eschew your fear and proclaim
    innocence. You need to embrace your fear and use the energy it gives you and
    remember the lessons it gives you. Rational fear is healthy, and is just
    another label for "experience." The OP's heart is in the right place, but
    the elocution is dangerous.

    Never ever forget your fear.

    I have been programming for +20 years. I may partially agree with your
    slogan from a hobbyist point of view, but when it comes to being a
    professional, I think this is bad advice. Software Engineering is a
    profession, at least here in BC, Canada.

    the additional requirements for the Software Engineering discipline.

    In BC, you require a license to call yourself a Software Engineer and
    practice software engineering. There is a legal framework around this and
    consequences can be as severe as being sued, aside from losing your license.
    There is also a code of ethics:

    How can you regain your innocence? Become a Professional. Don’t devalue your
    work or yourself by saying fuck it.

    I think he is talking about lost creativity, not degrees, requirements and
    lawsuits (wtf? law suites for some bad shape code ? well, sometimes you
    write/read code that deserve some punishment but lets leave the lawyers out
    of this!)

    Well said man!\
    I have been through those two phases and now try regain my innocent coding
    practices for good, regardless of what others think. It was definitely good
    to find your post!\
    There are many reasons I am doing that. \
    But one, perhaps the most important is to keep up the pace of the
    development technologies you have to be an "innocent developer". That way
    you can avidly learn new stuff with no fear of failing. Then you´ll improve
    your findings and learn some more new stuff. And that´s a skill.

    Thanks!

    Great blog post, exactly what I needed to get out of my own analysis
    paralysis! \
    Great programmers are great because they are the least self-conscious about
    the code they write. Their skills and ability to write superb code comes
    from the hours they have put to the art. In other words, just write it!

    Lol. Hahahaha... Please better stop coding for sake of sanity of
    programmers. :) Or if you disregard coding conventions, peer reviews and etc
    contact me, I can tell comapny names, that disregard this shit as much as
    you and fixing any bug takes 6h+ and some are unsolvable in finite amount of
    time.

    My conclusion. Don't knowing the fear of applying change, progressing,
    writing your code and generally developing is a good thing. But hacking,
    dismissing some well known standards, doing things fast instead of properly,
    it's a path to unsolvable problems and epic failure in future that will
    eventually come.

    After reading this and doing some thought about it I can't disagree.
    Programming is playing, it's a game, and it takes some childish personality
    to do it right. When two good programmers play together is like seeing two
    kids building a sand castle in the sandbox, imagining how it could be
    cooler. Is much more fun to play with friends than alone.

    For the ones like me that started programming at a young age, we started
    playing with the computer. After doing some GW Basic I discovered C and was
    like open the big brother closed and finding all his grown up toys ! much
    more dangerous and much more fun !

    Eventually, someone offers you money to play a game they need, and instead
    of play it is a job. But deep your heard it is still a game, a challenging
    game that consumes the intellect and always is asking you for more. A real
    neverending game with multiple plots, toys, rules and obstacles.

    Developing kicks the shit out of any other game.

    And fear doesn't mix well with playing.
