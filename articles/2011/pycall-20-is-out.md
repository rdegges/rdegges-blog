### pycall 2.0 is Out

May 1 2011, 11:34 PM  by Randall Degges

Just pushed pycall 2.0 to the world. It's been a long time coming.

If you aren't familiar with it by now, pycall is a python wrapper around
Asterisk call files. I created the project a long time ago, and have been
updating it gradually over the years.

The 2.0 release contains a full re-write of the code. It now has a full unit
test suite, a lot more modular design, 100% test coverage, full sphinx
documentation, and a sexy website.
