### My New Office

March 16 2011, 11:18 AM  by Randall Degges

As a programmer, I spend a lot of time in my office. It's my sanctuary. It's
where I do all of my work, where I learn a lot of new things, and where I have a
lot of fun.

Since I moved into my new apartment several months back, I've had a pretty
decent setup. I had a 6-foot costco desk (hey, they're only 50\$), and used that
to hold all of my stuff. It wasn't pretty--but it worked. A few days ago Sami
and I were at Office Depot and I saw a desk I couldn't leave behind, so I
ordered it. Yesterday it arrived, and I finally got it all built and setup (with
the help of Sami, and my sister). It's a large corner desk and a new cedar /
leather chair. Definitely a step up.

I decided to take pictures of the whole thing (my old desk, me cleaning out the
room, me building the new desk and chair, and the final result). Let me know
what you think! I love checking out other people's workplaces, and I hope you
enjoy mine!
