Building a Web Business
=======================

I've been really interested in all sorts of technology solutons and
businesses for the past year. I've read tons of books on lean startups,
agile business, and everything in between. I've also watched closely as
lots of new companies have started this year, and decided to fully
document their startup experience-- planning, brainstorming,
development, advertising, etc.

One of my goals for this year (to finish by January 1, 2012) is to
launch some sort of paid web service, and after procrastinating on this
goal for quite some time (I can't belive the year is almost half over),
I'm going to give it a shot. And what better way to hold myself
accountable, and keep things exciting--then by writing about it as I go
along?

So here's what I'm going to do: from this point on, I'm going to fully
document the entire process on my site. The entire thing--from
brainstorming and business ideas, to implementation, launching,
advertising, etc. The whole deal.

Be sure to check back in the coming days and weeks to get the juicy
details!
