### More Writing (Again)

April 11 2011, 9:38 PM  by Randall Degges

I decided to start writing more frequently on this website again. I've been
slacking off somewhat in my studies over the past few months, and writing has
always been a good way for me to get my thoughts in order, and really understand
the topics I'm writing about.

Over the next few weeks I'll be publishing articles more frequently, about a
variety of subjects (not only technical stuff anymore), so if you aren't
subscribed to the [RSS feed][], now would be a good time to do so!

Also--got any specific python / django / tech topics you'd like to see
discussed? Let me know!
