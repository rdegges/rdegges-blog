Announcing django-quotes
========================

I bet you thought I was dead! It has been quite a while since my last
post. Despite my previous writing conviction, I managed to work myself
into somewhat of a writing slump the past several months. Life has been
extremely busy for me:

-   Got married.
-   Been working extremely hard at my new company, developing
    earth-shattering software.
-   Been adjusting myself to the married lifestyle.
-   Been doing a *lot* of reading (mostly tech books, but also some
    fiction stuff).

Things have finally cooled down enough that I now have some time to
write, and work on side projects again, so please bare with me over the
next few weeks as I try to publish some interesting stuff.

Anyhow…

I’d like to announce the release of a new open source Django
application, django-quotes.

django-quotes is a small Django application which makes it easy to store
and display quotes on any Django-powered website. I wrote django-quotes
as part of another webapp I’ve been building (which I will launch in the
next week or so), and used it as a way to reaffirm all I’ve been
learning / doing with Django over the past several months.

The app is extremely simple, but well-documented, and functional. It
provides users a way to store quotes in their website database (you can
add quotes manually through the Django admin panel if you’d like), as
well as a simple template tag, `show_random_quote`, which displays a
random quote right into your Django template.

While django-quotes isn’t complex, I’ve tried to write it using all of
the best-practices I’ve learned along the way. Please let me know what
you think, and if you have any suggestions, let me know so I can fix it
up.
