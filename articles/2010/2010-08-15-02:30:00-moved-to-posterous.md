Moved to Posterous
==================

So, today I finally finished moving my old posts to
[Posterous](http://posterous.com/). If you aren’t familiar with them,
Posterous is a web hosting platform with some pretty cool features
(syntax highlighting, custom theme support, markdown support, email
support, etc.).

After a really LONG battle (which may not be over yet!) with myself, I
decided to take the plunge and give it a go. So as of today,
projectb14ck.org is now fully hosted @ Posterous.

The main reason I decided to use Posterous (instead of Tumblr, or one of
the other guys) was that they supported Markdown and syntax
highlighting. These are both a must for me, as:

1.  I version control all of my posts using Git. I get a lot of benefit
    out of using markdown as I can basically write all posts in txt
    format, which is easily identifyable regardless of editor / template
    rendering engine.
2.  I write a lot of technical posts, so syntax highlighting is a must.
3.  Posterous supports Github’s gist embedding, which is basically a
    javascript include that displays some code with syntax highlighting
    for easy download.

Anyhow, now that I’ve got my platform ready for writing again, I will
continue updating my site and posting cool information.
