### The Purely Functional Python Brainfuck Challenge

July 5 2010, 1:00 PM  by Randall Degges

As some of you know, I am very close friends with the people over at
[NEVERFEAR][]. They raised me, taught me most of what I know about programming,
and have some of the coolest and most unique people you could possibly meet.

They recently announced via their IRC channel that they’re hosting a functional
programming challenge to encourage programmers (like me) who don’t have any
functional programming experience to take a dive into the unknown, and learn a
few new skills.

The challenge they are presenting is coding a *purely* functional [brainfuck][]
interpreter. This means that there can be no objects, no loops, etc., and that
your program must largely be of the python `lambda` statement using lambda
calculus to solve the problem.

I’m going to be entering the challenge, along with a few other people in the
NEVERFEAR crew, and if you’d like to do so, please send me an email or join up
on our IRC channel: irc.neverfear.org:6697/\#neverfear (SSL), I promise it will
be a lot of fun, and very educational.

I’ll also be writing about my experiences with functional programming in python,
and sharing my insights and learnings along the way.

NEVERFEAR is an educational community for computer programmers, mathmaticians,
and other geeks who all share the drive to learn new things, and push technical
boundaries.

If you want to learn more about python and functional programming, check out
