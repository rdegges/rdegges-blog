Title: Getting Back on Track


Hi everyone,

As you may have noticed, I haven't been writing much the past few months. I've
been pretty busy with work, and have been incubating several new ideas and
strategies that have been stealing all of my focus.

I wanted to let you all know that over the next month (should be finished before
the new year), I'll be making some big changes to \`projectb14ck\` (my personal
website), as well as all my other project websites. I promise more updates in
the coming months, with interesting content and articles (back to my tech roots,
'yo).

Thanks for reading, and be sure to check back over the next few weeks for some
cool new stuff :)
