Title: Introducing asterdoc


Today I launched the coming soon page for my latest project (which will be an
ongoing project over the next few years): [http://asterdoc.org/][]

What is `asterdoc`? asterdoc is going to be 'The Unofficial Asterisk
Documentation Project', which will be a free online book (maybe in print
someday) similar to the 'Dive Into Python' book by Mark Pilgrim (which you can
check out here: [http://diveintopython3.org/][]).

The goals of the asterdoc project are to:

-   Create high quality documentation, which answers the following questions:
    -   What is Asterisk?
    -   How can Asterisk be used?
    -   What hardware will Asterisk run on?
    -   How can I install Asterisk?
    -   How can I configure Asterisk?
    -   How can I program with Asterisk?

-   Provide accurate, up-to-date information on current and future Asterisk
    releases.
-   Provide a one stop resource for tech people wanting to deploy their own
    Asterisk server.
-   Provide a series of best practices and design patterns for configuring
    Asterisk.
-   Provide in-depth technical API information that other programmers can use to
    write Asterisk modules, add-ons, and telephony applications.

For a long time, the [Asterisk project][] has needed documentation, and my hope
is that one day asterdoc will be a suitable source of documentation for any
techies working with it.

current code and book content.
