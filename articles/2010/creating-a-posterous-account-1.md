### Creating a Posterous Account

July 22 2010, 5:00 PM  by Randall Degges

So, I’m going to try out this whole Posterous thing. The main reason for it, is
that I currently host and maintain my weblog by hand. This is rather cumbersome,
as I have to constantly fiddle with my VPS, worry about bandwidth costs, and
also worry about breaking other software applications that I run on my VPS via
upgrades.

So, it came down to either Posterous or Tumblr, and after a careful comparison,
it seems that Posterous supports Markdown (yey!), which all my posts are
currently written in, and that Posterous also supports code with syntax
highlighting, another yey, as most of my posts are technical by nature, and
require pretty code blocks throughout.

This is my first post, creating my new Posterous account, and if everything goes
well, I’ll continue using the service.
