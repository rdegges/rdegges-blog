### The World Would Be a Better Place if Everyone Was a Hacker

There are a lot of problems with the world today. There have been, are, and
always will be problems with the world; this is unavoidable. By nature, humans
are emotional at the core, which severely inhibits our decision making, and
leads us to make poor choices.

The question is, how can we make the world a better place? By ‘make the world a
better place’, I simply mean improve every aspect of life. This can mean things
like:

-   Less war.
-   Higher standards of living.
-   More environmentally friendly practices.
-   More caring and supportive communities.
-   etc.

The only way to make the world a better place is to consciously analyze a
situation, think of ways to improve the situation, and then make the necessary
changes to improve the situation.

Now, let’s say that the situation you consciously think about and plan on
improving is large and generic, something like ‘make my neighborhood nicer’.
There is not a direct path to making your neighborhood nicer, so you’ll need to
break the situation into smaller, sub-situations which are more easily managed.

For instance, to make your neighborhood nicer, you could:

-   Increase the average income of residents of your community.
-   Provide better education for community members.
-   Have better support programs to help residents.
-   Re-pave the roads.
-   Re-model buildings.

And for any one of those sub-problems, you can break it down further. Let’s say
we decide to re-pave the roads, this could be accomplished by:

-   Raising taxes to get more money for road paving.
-   Paving the roads yourself.
-   Raising donated monies for road paving.
-   Elect new city counsel members who pledge to pave the roads.
-   Run for city counsel yourself, and make sure that the roads are paved.
-   etc.

This logical mentality of analyzing a problem, breaking it into smaller
problems, and then solving the most minimal problem is a typical trait of a
hacker. That is what hackers do. They solve problems, step-by-step.

Our society needs more hackers. We need more people who will consciously look
for problems, break them into smaller components, and then solve each component.

Imagine if an entire city of 10,000 people all consciously decided to look for
ways to make their community a nicer place. With 10,000 individuals, each
tackling a small problem, big things would begin to happen very quickly.

The problem with our world is that there are very few hackers. Most people do
not like solving problems, and prefer to let others solve problems for them. I
think this is a mistake.

The next time you see a problem, think of ways to break it into smaller pieces,
and then think of ways to solve each piece. Anything can be achieved by simply
putting conscious thought into it, and when enough people begin to analyze their
surroundings, and actively participate in their community, amazing things
happen.

    I disagree. Like the rest of the hacker and startup community, everyone
    seems to love to live inside their own bubble and beliefs. Everyone being a
    hacker is not the solution. And no, being a hacker does not mean you're
    automatically equipped to be logical. Plenty of hackers outside of writing
    code are illogical idiots.

    What the world needs is less lazy people, less people giving up at the first
    sign of doing something hard, and more people logically assessing what
    they're trying to do (some of the things you list that has no relevance to
    whether or not a person is a hacker or not).

    We are doing that. We were doing it before it was cool. Been doing that back
    when "hacking" still meant a haphazard slice with a cutting implement. Been
    doing it for over 200 years here in the states. It's called
    democracy+capitalism. You are welcome.

    The reason the world is full of crappy, lazy people is because being crappy
    and lazy has its benefits - others solve your problem for you, and you get
    the solution without having paid the (mental) price. Evolution has selected
    the fittest, and in today's world, those who can exploit others for their
    own purposes, are considered the fittest. Until that is changed, nothing you
    suggested will come to be.

    You know where hackers have moved recently?

    To the financial industry. See what that gave us.

    What we need is \*ethical\* people, and knowledgeable enough to be. Our
    current economic system pretty much encourages just the opposite.

    And what the frack are we hackers supposed to do with more paved roads?

    Very good point. A call to intelligence and self-determination. This is not
    political, it's just giving back to the people what they've lost through
    years and years of brain washing and institutionalized support.\
    You can think far beyond roads and start to wonder who in your community is
    able to grow enough food of it to become autonomous. Same for energy and
    water and everything. Because there might be a time when all this will
    become the norm and educating people to become hackers again is a very long
    process.

    And is your writing of this article constitute your small deed to help your
    community?

    Great article, one of the best I've read in a while. With a general interest
    in helping educate people, not collecting hits.
