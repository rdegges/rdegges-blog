pycall 1.3 Released
===================

Earlier today I received an email from [Marcelo
Araujo](mailto:marcelo@midivts.org) which contained a patch for
[pycall](http://pycall.org/) to add support for local trunks. So I
patched pycall up, updated the changelog, the builds, and pushed
everything out.

The problem with the earlier versions of pycall is that they didn’t
properly support local trunks. In Asterisk, local trunks allow you to
dial numbers locally to your system, which is useful for people who want
to let their Asterisk dial plan configurations control the dialing logic
of the call. I completely overlooked that when I was first writing
pycall. The reason why (specifically) it didn’t work before was that
pycall would build all dial strings in this format
`TRUNK_TYPE/TRUNK_NAME/NUMBER` so that the Channel directive of the call
file would look something like `Channel: Local/internal/18882223333`
which works great for SIP, ZAP, DAHDI, IAX2, and other trunks—but not
for local! Local trunks have to be written in the following manner to
work `Channel: Local/18882223333@internal`.

So thanks again to Marcelo for helping find and fix that annoying issue!
And to anyone else out there who finds issues with pycall, please let me
know!
