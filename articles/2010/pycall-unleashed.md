### pycall Unleashed

January 27 2010, 8:00 PM  by Randall Degges

A few months back I released the first version of my rather popular Asterisk
call file library, [pycall][]. pycall is a python library which makes creating
and using Asterisk call files extremely, EXTREMELY easy. Since its inception,
I’ve used pycall in several production environments, and for various other small
projects that I’ve worked on.

The past couple weeks I’ve been working on my web design skills, and decided to
make an information site for pycall which contains documentation, examples, and
a tutorial to help users get acquainted with the neat features that pycall
offers. So I present to you: [http://pycall.org/][]. Check it out and let me
know what you think :)

Also, if you’ve used pycall for a project, and want to get famous, see
[http://pycall.org/examples][]. I’m asking for any code contributions to host up
there and share with the world.

Enjoy.
