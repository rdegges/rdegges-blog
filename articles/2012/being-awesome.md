If you want to be awesome, then go be awesome.

Code the stuff you want to code.  Build the business you want to build.  Lift
the weights.  Lose the weight.  Go the extra mile.

Don't listen to anyone else, just get out there, do what you love, and fucking
KICK ASS along the way.

Don't yield for anyone.
