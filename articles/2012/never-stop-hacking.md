### Never Stop Hacking

April 16 2012, 9:27 PM  by Randall Degges

![][]

This is a quick post, something that I have to get out of my mind and onto paper
(err, the internets!).

I was thinking earlier today about what makes me happy--really, truly happy. I
had just stopped coding, and was feeling frustrated that my builds weren't
working like I had hoped. I decided to go onto [IRC][] for some procrastination,
and ended up chatting with a really good friend.

My friend (who will remain unnamed), is an extremely smart fellow. One of the
smartest I've ever had the pleasure of talking to. He's a fucking amazing
programmer, always positive, and constantly learning new things. As we were
talking about programming, I started to feel better. I started to feel excited.
My frustration began to melt away, and all that was left was desire.

The desire to learn new things. The desire to build something that has never
before been built. The desire to hunt down problems--and then solve them.

It was at this moment I realized something. Something which, to me, is an
incredibly powerful revelation. Often times, I find myself hunting for
solutions. I find myself desperately trying to figure out what I should do about
X, and how to optimize Y. I find myself searching for solutions to problems,
hoping to get them out of the way as quickly as possible so that I can move onto
the next thing, the next chore, the next item on my todo list. It was in this
moment that it all became clear to me--

I enjoy the problems. I *crave* them.

The more I focus on solutions, the more I treat them as a chore, as a task that
needs to be finished--the more stressed and frustrated I become. It is only when
I focus on the *experience*, the act of learning something new and hunting down
problems, that I feel really, *truly* happy.

As programmers, we're given a unique gift: the ability to spend a majority of
our time learning things and solving problems. The next time I'm feeling
stressed, frustrated, or even angry--I'm going to remember that it's the process
I really enjoy--that the process of learning new things is what really motivates
me, and makes me love what I do so much.

**Never stop hacking.**

    "I'm not trying to break any records, Spock. I'm doing this because I enjoy
    it. Not to mention the most important reason for climbing a mountain."

    "And that is?"

    "Because it's there."

    A really good Post! I can defiantly feel with you. I'm studying Computer
    Engineering in the first half. And my favorite Subject atm still is the
    Programming 1 (we're doing Java). And when I think of my past about learning
    programming, (C/C++/C\#, Python, Java), i almost every time stopped at the
    point where learning new things became complicated and took more time and
    the given problems couldn't be solved "right away".

    Now, when I've read your Post - I'm finding right me in that text.

    I'm feeling bad and just unhappy when there are no new programming tasks on
    our servers we have to solve until next week, as well as I'm feeling unhappy
    when I'm not coming out with a "brilliant solution" within a few hours.

    Thank you for giving me the possibility to learn something quite important
    about me in only a few minutes, by reading your text!

    I hope I won't stop! :)

    Nicely written. I am a designer and i could just replace "Hacking" with
    "Designing" in your post and make it mine :-)

    Great distinction, Randall! Indeed, short, but very powerful observation. I
    wish you the best in encountering currently unfathomable problems in your
    future. Thanks for sharing.

    I know the feeling - You struggle with something for hours, get frustrated,
    and do something else (Generally sleep, since it's subsequently 4:00am :p).

    You're lying in bed, nice and comfortable, drifting off to sleep...

    When suddenly - "Wait - If I had just shifted the input of this procedure to
    the next function outside the loop - It'd work! o\_O"

    Aaah - The wonders of being a programmer :)

    what i hate is when its not a problem that needs solved just a task that
    needs done. something you know how to do but just dont feel like doing.

    Amen to the Post. My best work happens when I ask a forum how something can
    be done and the comeback is 'you can't do that'. It's what we hackers live
    for.

    Too bad you have to use your sparetime cause the compeny you works for
    demands ROI and consider you as an investment rather than a human being....

    Off topic, but looking at the picture at the top with the skeleton striking

    You're right. This is the same that happens to me and I think that the
    solution to focus the attention to the experience is very importat and give
    a new recharge of energy.\
