### How I Learned to Program

February 3 2012, 10:18 PM  by Randall Degges

![][]

Programming is, without a doubt, the most mentally rewarding thing I've ever
done. Programming taught me that life should be fun, filled with creativity, and
lived to the fullest. Programming taught me that anything is possible; I can do
anything I want using only my mind.

Programming also taught me that learning is fun. It showed me that the more you
know, the more power you have. Programming showed me that a life filled with
learning is a life worth living. Programming revealed to me who I am inside, and
has continuously helped me work towards my goals.

I feel extremely lucky to have had the means and opportunity to learn
programming early in my life. While my methods are certainly not optimal for
everyone, they worked well for me.

I have no regrets.

So I figured I'd share my methods with you, in hopes that a beginner will read
this and get some value out of it.

If you don't want to read all this, the important takeaway here is to, above all
else, **have fun**.

Install Linux on Your Box

![][1]

While in my own life, I actually learned quite a bit about computers through
video games on MSDOS computers--my real learning started the first day I
installed a linux operating system on my home computer.

It doesn't matter whether or not you use Windows on your laptop, or if you have
a Macbook Air--if you want to learn to program well, you need to use linux.
Sure, there are a ton of great programmers out there using other systems, but
you cannot beat linux as a learning machine.

Despite what you may think, programmers don't just "program". Programming as you
probably think of it is nothing more than input and output. You type things, and
stuff happens. This is incorrect.

![][2]

Programming is a way of life.

Programmers are people obsessed with knowledge. Programmers use this obsession
to fuel a life of learning, discovery, and creation. That is the true definition
of a programmer.

A big reason to use linux for your day to day work is that it helps you
passively learn about programming as you use it. On Windows, if you want to copy
a file from one box to another, you drag and drop. On linux, if you want to copy
a file from one box to another, you use scp or rsync. Learning how to use the
command line teaches you basic technical logic and problem solving skills.

Another important skill you passively acquire by using linux is self
sufficiency. Unlike many other lines of work, programming does not require you
to memorize a million things, or repeatedly do the same thing over and over
again; instead, programming requires intense self motivation and determination.

Even the best programmers typically have no idea what they're doing when they
start a new project. If I could summarize one thing I do more than anything else
as a programmer, it would be **research**. Programmers must know how to lookup
information, and how to process and use that information in a useful manner.
This skill is typically acquired over long periods of time--but linux can help.

Using linux will require you to actively seek out solutions to problems. If you
don't know how to setup an SSH tunnel--you **will** learn. Using linux will
drive you to discover new things you never would have thought of while using Mac
or Windows. As you slowly become a better and better linux user, you will
coincidentally become a better and better programmer and pragmatist. You'll
learn how to go about solving problems. How to hunt down errors. How to use your
combined knowledge to create new things and make your life (and others' lives)
easier.

Furthermore, since linux (as well as a majority of its applications) is open
source, you're in a great position to learn more about programming culture. At
one point or another, I can almost guarantee you will:

-   Find a bug in an application you use.
-   You'll search for an answer online.
-   You'll find either a ticket system or a forum for the software you're using.
-   You'll submit a ticket about the bug, or post on the forum stating your
    problem.
-   Interact with other users like yourself to help resolve the issue.

While this may not sound cool now, just wait. Once you've done the above, you'll
really be acquainted with the tech community. Finding problems, discussing them
with others, and solving problems is what makes the technical community thrive.

If everything was perfect and there were no problems to solve in the world--life
would be boring. Getting out there and fixing stuff--fighting chaos--that makes
life worth living. So enjoy it!

Linux can help teach you these things, and more.

Have an Intense Desire

![][3]

Why do you want to program? What is motivating you? What drives you? Unless you
desperately want to learn programming, you will fail.

When I started coding, it was because I had an intense desire to hack video
games. Back when I was a kid, video games were my life. I would rush home from
school and spend as long as I could on the computer playing old classics. Some
of my fondest memories are playing epic Starcraft matches against my brother
(we'd have no rush 2 hour games where we'd max out our units and have battles
that would cause our GPUs to quake in terror).

More than anything, I wanted to hack the shit out of those games. I wanted to
**dominate** them. I wanted to **enslave** my computer and have it do my
bidding.

While my old motivations are silly to me now, back then I felt them intensely.
I'd dream about it at night, constantly think about it during the day, and
obsess about it while I was on the computer in the afternoon.

When I set my mind towards learning to program, I knew I would make it happen. I
knew that no matter what happened in my life, I'd either learn to program or I'd
die trying. It was what I can only describe as a glorious feeling. It was
similar to that feeling you have where you want something so bad, so intensely,
that you feel it with every muscle in your body.

Regardless of the fact that I had absolutely no idea what I was doing--that I
knew absolustely no technical people whatsoever--that I had no resources--and
that I had zero guidance--I found a way. I ruthlessly read through internet
tutorials on random webpages. I spend hundreds of hours scouring random forums
looking for bits of information.

The most important thing, however, is that because I wanted it so bad, it felt
easy. I've always been an all-or-nothing type of person, and I think that this
helped me break through the initial barriers and eventually become a half decent
programmer.

Build Small Command Line Programs

![][4]

A lot of people now-a-days seem to be learning programming by diving head first
into web development. While this may work for some people, it seems pretty damn
crazy to me. Not only are web technologies complex and vast (building a modern
website requires a ton of separate skills that take years to mature), but
they're frustrating and discouraging for new developers.

Maybe I'm old school (I'm only 23 :x), but there is nothing more satisfying (and
educational!) than writing a ton of simple, command line programs.

I can't even begin to express how useful this was in my programming education.
For the longest time (after I gained a basic understanding of programming) I'd
rush home from school, sit down at my computer, and spend 5 or 6 hours writing a
simple command line utility. I'd write tons of things:

-   A simple program that takes in filenames as input, and stores those files
    all in an organized directory hierarchy depending on the file type.
-   An IRC bot that logs all channel activity to a text file.
-   A simple program that downloads all the images on a given web page.
-   A tool to convert base 10 numbers to any other base on the CLI.
-   A provisioning script that installs all my OS customizations: wallpapers,
    themes, etc.
-   A basic screenshot program that automatically uploads screenshot to an image
    hosting website, and copies the resulting URL into the clipboard for instant
    copy-paste fun.
-   And a million other things.

I got so much value out of these small exercises. Each one was simple enough to
be written in several hours (no more), and each one taught me stuff: either a
new language, library, or strategy. There's no doubt in my mind that I gained a
good portion of my programming knowledge through building these apps.

The other benefit to building these small apps is confidence. Each app I built
was a huge personal accomplishment. I felt proud of each one. I'd maintain all
of them, and periodically rewrite the code using all the new strategies I'd
learn. This taught me basic iterative programming (making improvements over
time), and how to really contribute to the open source world.

If you're a new programmer, I doubt there's anything better (or more fun) than
writing a ton of small command line utilities. Don't believe me? Try it, and
tell me you aren't addicted after the first one!

Write, Write, Write

![][5]

Writing is a bit controversial. When I started programming, nerds had a
reputation for being bad at everything except computers. For a while, I assumed
that since I was good at computers, I was naturally worse at everything else:
writing included.

That's bullshit.

I've come to realize over the years that programmers are, in particular,
excellent writers. The ability to think logically and solve problems is a great
writing asset. It's particularly hard to explain your thoughts in writing. In my
opinion, having strong programming skills makes this much easier, since as a
programmer, you're used to arguing with logic and use it everyday in your work.

Through the process of writing a lot, you'll greatly improve your reasoning
ability, and consequently, become a better programmer.

As a programmer, having a blog is a great way to practice writing. It's a great
way to keep track of the things you learn, and help ensure you are always making
progress. Through the process of writing about things, techincal things in
particular, you'll greatly increase your knowledge on the subject.

For instance, if you're writing a CLI app that orders pizza through Dominos, it
would be hard to write about that without going into detail describing the
technology you're using, how the Domino's API works, etc. By taking the time to
write about your experiences working with their API, you'll consequently learn a
lot more than you would if you didn't.

Writing can be amazingly helpful when used to describe technical stuff, as it
really simplifies and clarifies the root of the problem--forcing you to think of
the problem in the simplest way possible. I can't tell you how many times I've
worked on a really tough problem, then taken the time to write about it and
realized that I vastly overcomplicated the issue.

One of my biggest regrets is that over the years I threw away a vast majority of
my articles. Over time I rewrote my website frequently, mismanaged servers, and
slowly lost most of my writing. This blog you're reading now exists primarily as
the result of my decision to save all my future writings and provide a home for
them that I won't mistakely lose. Don't make the same mistake I did!

Join an Online Community

![][6]

The internet is a big place. Programming is a big field. While it is certainly
possible to become an excellent programmer by yourself, completely isolated--it
is much easier to do it with the help of friends.

When I started programming I was lucky enough to meet some amazing like-minded
programmers online using [IRC][]. The people I met were some of the smartest,
passionate, and most motivated individuals I've ever met in my life. We're still
friends today!

Having other insanely passionate and driven friends kept me motivated, and
helped push me to be the best I could. We wrote articles for one another to
share things we learned--we critiqued each other's code. We talked about
projects we were working on, and what the best way to implement them was.

Having a group of people with the same passion and drive as yourself cannot be
understated.

Finding a group like this, on the otherhand, is extremely difficult. I highly
recommend using IRC (as a lot of bright people seem to use it), and gradually
joining new channels and chatting with people who share similar interests. If,
in the offchance you're like me, and want to hang out in the same circle, you're
invited to check out [\#heapify][].

Have Fun

![][7]

Programming is fun. Programming is really, insanely fun. Just writing about it
makes me feel happy inside. It's hard to contain my excitement.

The most important part of learning to program is to always **HAVE FUN**!
Regardless of whether you're just getting into programming, or whether you've
been a programmer for a long time: having fun is the most important thing you
can do.

Let's say you're just starting to learn [python][] ([Dive Into Python][] is
still one of the best python books ever written, by the way)--don't start by
writing some boring project. Write something new! Something that you will find
useful. Have fun with it, and challenge yourself.

If your sole motivation for working on a project is to get it done, you're
cheating yourself. Part of being a good programmer is building stuff that
**YOU** find cool. There is plenty of dreary software in the world, what the
world needs is more **AWESOME** software. And the only way to make awesome
software is to have fun building it!

I could literally go on ranting about how much fun programming is indefinitely.
But instead, I want to challenge **YOU** (ya, you!). Think of something you'd
really love to build: maybe it's a file sharing site, maybe a video
editor--whatever excites you and gives you that warm fuzzy feeling inside. Got
it?

**OK**, now go build it!

Regardless of where you are in your programming career: always have fun, and
keep pushing yourself!

    Thank you :)\
    I'm 18 and made quite the same experience (even with the starcraft
    playing)...\
    finally i have something that i can link to, that describes this

    i have to say i made a bit different experience with OSs.. i was quite a
    windows user for a long time.. then i built my own home server and went into
    linux and it became my main OS.. then mac.. then all three for some time and
    now mainly mac\
    personally i think that a deep understanding of all the mayor OSs really
    helps to become a programmer and that you can also learn about bash and
    open-source tools, ticket systems and stuff on mac

    As a beginning programmer, I have found getting started difficult. I love
    the programming process. However, with a small child and an infant, finding
    the right resources has been a challenge. "Does that book really do what it
    says BEFORE I buy it?" "No, you cannot play Angry Birds right now; Mommy's
    working." "But you don't have a job." I do have a job. It's taking care of
    two kids while learning to program. After an Associate's and Technical
    Degrees, I have recently started a blog (codemonkeymomma.com) to give my
    time in school and staying home with children legitimacy. It is currently
    focusing on computer basics, but I look forward to when I can focus more on
    coding. \
    Your article helped reignited my passion and focus my efforts. I have been
    thinking of installing Linux for years but was too chicken. I have now
    installed it last night and have a Linux dedicated machine. I've heard
    Python is the place to really start. I have some HTML/CSS and Java
    experience from school, but that is the extend of my knowledge.\
    I have followed your blog and look forward to hearing more from you in the

    Great Article!

    I have never used linux (except for xbmc live if that counts =))\
    Could use some starting tips for using "Linux for programming". What distro
    to use ? tools? etc.

-   Feb 6 2012, 4:18 AM

    Nathan Dimitriadis responded:

    @Henry you might wanna try for starters to download Ubuntu from
    [www.ubuntu.com][]. If you never used Linux before make sure that you will
    download a live-CD version of Ubuntu and use it for a few hours to get your
    feet wet.

    Ubuntu is a very popular Linux distro and found great help in the unofficial
    forums in [www.ubuntuforums.org][] (stuff like GPU compatibility etc) as
    well as installation guides. As for the tools there are plentiful and,
    depending of what you're aiming to do. I like using Vim and Sublime text 2
    for Python and overall web development (Sublime text 2 isn't free though)
    and for Java the usual Netbeans and Eclipse.

    If you decide to go deeper into the Linux programming you can skip Ubuntu
    and try Archlinux (something which I intend to do in a few minutes) but
    that's when you're confident enough and ready to advance into deeper Linux
    waters. But it will worth it.

    Dan Sutton responded:
    Great article, but I'm not sure about the Linux thing: in my experience, you
    spend more time figuring out how to get around the fact that it's as
    friendly as a cornered rat and that nothing hangs together properly in it
    than you do actually constructing any real software... and I've been
    programming since the days when a home computer consisted of a breadboard
    with two LED numbers as its display. You're right about one thing, though:
    programming represents the pinnacle of mental achievement: it's a way of
    life, all right.

    @Brian there's absolutely no need to feel like that. I'm also 30 years old

    the subpar education that I received along with the erroneous career advice
    had convinced me to give up in my dream. After 6 years of IT administration
    and management I took the big leap of self-education and I'll return to
    proper education for a CS degree as soon as possible.

    wow amazing article. this resonates with me so much especially the part
    "When I set my mind towards learning to program, I knew I would make it
    happen..." that intense desire to keep pushing and learning, that passion
    for me was the greatest thing about learning how to code. i did it all, read
    books, practised and learning new techniques.

    then after sometime, somehow i lost the passion, i became too focused on
    money which lead to me almost destroying the thing i love, which is
    programming. these were dark days for me but luckily i saw the light and
    since then i've ignited my flame again, it took a while for me to regain
    this passion and i'm still making peace with my daemons but at least the
    desire to code is back which i'm thankful for. its guys like you who inspire
    us, thank you again for sharing this.

    Light, Love and Coding!!!

    Nice read! I used to write little BASIC programs to solve math and physics

    simple variables and operations. I have always had a passion for automating
    things, or finding more efficient ways of doing things...some might call it
    laziness, but I prefer to think of it as 'maximizing liesure time'.
    Programming can be extremely rewarding, in that most of what you create is
    reusable.

    For the most part, I guess I agree.

    On the other hand, some of my experiences with various Linux distro
    communities does not leave me feeling warm and fuzzy about them. Even the
    Ubuntu IRC channel can be quite rude to new users. I also know of people
    having this issue with real-life interactions with Linux-nerds. For example,
    my boyfriend was very excited to try Ubuntu out on his desktop several years
    ago. He got it installed, but his network card wouldn't work. He went to our
    college's CS club (who usually run Linux distro install weekends once a
    semester) and they treated him really poorly. They weren't interested in
    helping him fix the issue, and they made him feel like an idiot for having
    trouble with Ubuntu. My boyfriend refused to use Linux until he changed
    schools and became a CS student. I've seen new people ask questions about
    how to do something because there's something in the instructions that
    doesn't make sense or the instructions don't work, and they just get slammed
    for not being able to follow the instructions.

    From all of this, I'll research problems I'm having online, but I won't
    participate in most communities. If I still need help, I ask friends. - And
    to be clear, I'm a software engineer, in industry, with a thick skin for
    this kind of treatment (but that doesn't mean I'll needlessly subject myself
    to it).

    I'm not damning the entirety of Linux distro or OSS communities. There are
    good people in them, helpful people. But they are outnumbered by those who
    say they're accepting/welcoming of new users, but are actually elitist.

    ...sorry that i have not answered your e-mail, but a dear friend of over 40
    years had a relapse from the lithium pills he was taking for depression and
    mania.  He almost died, but he is OK now.....
     
    How are you doing?

    I've been a developer for \~25 years and I stopped reading when it came to
    installing Linux on my box. There was no Linux 25 years ago and there's no
    requirement to install Linux today in order to become a good developer. Any
    platform will do, no need to get heavily biased towards a single platform to
    make your point.

    Wise words. Programming is a mandatory skill that every techie must learn.
    I'm a programmer myself and the joy that you get from successfully compiling
    code is awesome! And I'm glad you advocate Linux. Linking to your post from
    my blog :)

    Found this old bookmark again and I couldn't be happier.

    I started studying computer science and one of the many reasons was this
    article.

    Thanks again for finding my motivation. :)
