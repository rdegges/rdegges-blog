Django and SSL
==============

![Cloaked](http://getfile1.posterous.com/getfile/files.posterous.com/temp-2012-05-31/udqaJiwxujwDidBBdAoootGAurDhhtssBuGIxjivmEhhpllqnxBwmgfayGvp/cloaked.jpg.scaled696.jpg)

I'm a huge proponent of [encrypting
everything](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2012/02/should-all-web-traffic-be-encrypted.html "Encrypt Everything").
Why make it easy for the government (or other nasty organizations) to
snoop on your personal data? As such, over the past several months I've
been slowly migrating all my Django sites to SSL. Along the way, I
realized how horrifically underserved the SSL library market actually is
for Django.

A quick search for 'Django + SSL' on google returned nothing useful. I
couldn't find any libraries or tools that made 'forcing HTTPs' a one
liner. The only useful thing I was able to dig up after a bit of hunting
was this
[StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8436666/how-to-make-python-on-heroku-https-only "Django + SSL")
post that contains some custom middleware code that forces HTTPs
redirection.

After a bit of unit testing (and some
[PyPI](http://pypi.python.org/pypi "pypi") action), I published
[django-sslify](https://github.com/rdegges/django-sslify "django-sslify")--a
simple Django app that forces all SSL across your Django site.

Setting up django-sslify is a piece of cake. Essentially--all you have
to do is install django-sslify (duh!) and then modify your Django
settings.py file like so:

~~~~ {.line_numbers}
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
~~~~

\# ...

\

MIDDLEWARE\_CLASSES = (

    'sslify.middleware.SSLifyMiddleware',

    \# ...

)

\

\# ...

Once you've done that, all HTTP requests to your site will be
perma-redirected to their https equivalents, forcing SSL encryption.

**NOTE**: If you're using [Heroku](http://www.heroku.com/ "Heroku") to
host your applications (like I am), be sure to use their new [SSL
endpoint](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/ssl-endpoint "SSL Endpoint")
addon. The new SSL endpoint addon makes using SSL as easy as possible.
