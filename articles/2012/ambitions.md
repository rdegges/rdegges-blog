### Ambitions

It's about 1am right now, and instead of sleeping I'm thinking about all the
things I want to accomplish, and what I need to do to get there.

While I'm currently really happy with my day-to-day life: I enjoy the things I'm
working on each day, I'm constantly learning new skills, I'm pushing myself past
my comfort barrier--I'm always craving *more*.

More skills, more connections, more victories, more struggles, more
achievements--more *everything*. Unfortunately, when I think about these things
(which I do quite often), I can't help but feel a bit guilty.

Internally, there's always a debate that takes place. One side of me says
"You're happy with what you're currently doing. Don't constantly focus on always
doing bigger, better things! Be content with yourself *now*!" While the other
side says "Go big! Don't settle for your current situation. Be happy with
yourself, but push yourself outside your limits, and don't yield!"

It's a struggle.

On one hand, I can see myself easily "going with the flow" and learning to be
content with myself. On the other hand--I don't want to give up my huge
ambitions without a fight.

Is this normal? Does everyone feel this way?

While both sides of the spectrum appeal to me, I must admit I'm quite a bit more
fond of the all-or-nothing approach. The idea of struggling through the pain,
sacrifice, and discipline of working towards my ambitions seems somewhat
romantic.

It's a fork in the road--but I suppose everyone has to choose at one point or
another.

    I don't think everyone has this problem, but most people who strive to be
    better tomorrow than they were today, do face this problem. And you are not
    alone. Personally I think it's alright to always push yourself, take a step
    forward as long as you are aware of where you are right and can appreciate
    your current position. Personally I've found that taking regular breaks
    help. I spend the day pushing myself and getting better and then in the
    evenings I relax. I read a book, watch some TV, cook some food, hang out
    with friends, take the time to appreciate what I did today and recharge the
    batteries for tomorrow. And in the morning I start the fight again, fully
    refreshed.

    I have always felt this way. The post reassures and somehow validates me. :)
