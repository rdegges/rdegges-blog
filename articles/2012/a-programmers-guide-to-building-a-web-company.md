### A Programmer's Guide to Building a Web Company From Scratch

November 28 2012, 2:10 PM  by Randall Degges

So, you want to build a web company. You read [Hacker News][]. You're subscribed
to the [startup subreddit][].

You know in the back of your mind that you want to build your own company (or
companies) because you want to:

-   Work on products you enjoy.
-   Spend your time doing what you *want* to do.
-   Be completely financially independent.
-   Build something that people love and enjoy using.

In this article, I'm going to walk you through the process of building your
first web company. Through the rest of this article, I'm going to make a few
assumptions about you:

-   You're a computer programmer.
-   You're comfortable writing web applications in your favorite programming
    language (python, ruby, whatever).
-   You're passionate about your work.

For reasons you'll see later, the above requirements are mandatory. What it
really boils down to is this: if you've always wanted to start your own web
company, but haven't gotten around to it yet, you're in the right place.

If you read through this article from top to bottom, you'll have gone through
the entire company building process: going from absolutely nothing to a fully
launched product (and beyond).

Ready? *Let's do this!*

The Most Important Thing

![][1]

There are many different types of companies on the web. Some manufacture
physical goods and sell them online, some provide services, some provide
information and consulting. The way these companies get their customers and make
money is largely a byproduct of their industry.

If you're running a programming consultancy, for example, you'd likely be
getting most of your customers through referrals--whereas an online company that
provides a software service may get most of its customers from google search
traffic.

While you can certainly build any company you want, I'm going to specifically
focus on building web companies that get a majority of their customers through
search. The reason is that these sorts of companies are:

-   Easier to start (require less upfront time and investmetn).
-   Easier to validate (finding customers through the internet is a lot easier
    than finding customres through friends, referrals, etc.).
