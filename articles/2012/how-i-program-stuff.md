### How I Program Stuff

January 16 2012, 7:54 PM  by Randall Degges

![][]

I love programming. I can truly say that of all the things I enjoy, I enjoy
programming the most. There's nothing quite like the feeling you get when you
create something. Writing code is a lot like building your own little universe.

When you build stuff, you're in complete control, and, no matter how hard you
fight it, your code directly reflects yourself. If you write sloppy code, I can
almost *guarantee* you'll be a sloppy person. If you haphazardly throw code
around with any care or passion, it's likely you treat yourself the same way.

I tend to think of myself as a [passionate programmer][] (subsequently, this is
one of the best books I've ever read). When I'm building things, I do so with a
lot of care. I like to:

-   Take my time, and not rush myself.
-   Maintain 100% strict style rules across the codebase. I'm a style nazi.
-   Ruthlessly refactor old or ugly code.
-   Put a lot of thought into the APIs available, and think of ways to minimize
    or get rid of them all together.
-   Keep a single, clear, and minimalistic purpose for the project.

I try to make every piece of code I touch a bit more like me (for better or
worse). With the above in mind, here's my method for programming stuff.

Step 1 - Isolate

![][1]

I work best in complete isolation (excluding the companionship of my dog,
Scribbles). I find that when I'm completely alone, with no distractions, I'm
able to really get into the proper mood for building things.

**Confidence.**

Being alone gives me a lot of confidence. If you're by yourself, you have
absolutely nothing to lose working on that funky feature branch that will
probably never work out, or attempting to refactor an enormous method that you
later realize was written that way for a very important reason. When you're by
yourself, there is nothing to be embarassed about. You have complete creative
freedom to try new things without consequence.

**Energy.**

Maybe it's because I'm deeply anti-social at my core, but for some reason, I'm
just not myself around other people. As (odd?) as that may be, being around
other people seems to really drain my energy and sap my creativeness. Despite my
best efforts, I just don't have the same energy around other people as I do by
myself. When I'm isolated, I have an enormous amount of mental energy that I
just can't help but use in creative endeavors.

**Information.**

I find that while alone, I'm able to make better use of available information.
For instance, when I'm working with other people (physically), I tend not to use
information resources as much. I won't google things, or read articles about the
topics I'm working on. When alone, I tend to spend much more time researching
relevant information, best practices, and learning skills that can help me do
what needs to be done.

Step 2 - Eliminate

![][2]

When it's time to really build things, the second thing I do is eliminate all
unnecessary information. This includes:

-   Closing all browser tabs and starting fresh.
-   Closing all terminal sessions.
-   Closing all IM conversations.
-   Moving everything off my desk.

With everything out of the way, I'm able to easily focus on programming things.
The code almost flows out naturally when nothing else is in the way, stopping
it.

**THOUGHT**: Maybe we're all meant to be programmers, and our environment is
simply stopping us from coding. In this case, it is our duty to eliminate all
distractions and return to our natural state!

Step 3 - Code Ruthlessly

![][3]

Coding ruthlessly is something I strongly believe in. I think that of all the
things I've learned over the years, this has been the most important.

There is no room in this world for fear while programming. As a programmer, you
have to be courageous, bold, fearless, and **ruthless**. If you can't bring
yourself to remove legacy code because you may need it later, you've failed.
Whenever I feel hesitation while programming, I make a mental note to seriously
reconsider what I'm doing. If it makes me feel uncomfortable, there's a good
chance I need to do that shit right away.

Being ruthless with your code means you make commits that fix whitespace, fix
indentation, remove entire source files, deprecate API calls, and drastically
change functionality--whatever needs to be done, you do it without a bit of
regret.

There have been countless times that I've worked on code for a week or two, just
to realize I went off on a tangent and completely strayed from the main
objective. In times like this, the only thing to do is remove everything and
move on. There is no room for ego in success.

**Be ruthless.**

How About You?

I'm extremely interested in how other people build stuff. If you've written

    This article is great. I spotted this gem:

    "If you write sloppy code, I can almost guarantee you'll be a sloppy
    person."

    I completely agree with this. Your environment is a reflection of your mind.
    How can anyone write clean code with messy thoughts?

    that needs to be taken.

    Terrific post. I sympathize with every point you make.

    Beyond starting with a clean desk, I also really enjoy that final state at
    the end of a long coding session (or maybe a week of these) when your work
    area has the topography of a jungle in a warzone. The final cleanup after it
    is all done is a great pleasure.

    Seems like you have a very similar approach to coding as I do. I see my code
    as art. It's the process of creation that gets me off the most. Like most
    artists the end product is usually for someone else to admire or use. I'm a
    hardcore code-nazi. Style of code has a lot of meaning. Just like a blob is
    styled, code should be styled similar. Code should be like reading an essay
    or a poem. How the eyes move across code to me is very very important. The
    faster I can parse my code the more less it gets in my way. I don't like
    reading code I like writing it. Unfortunately I would say 95% of the code
    I've ever worked with is shit. Its to bad more people don't see it as an art
    instead of a means to an end.

    What you describe above is what every developer wants. Isolation is
    comfortable, and ideal. Being able to investigate paths that might not lead
    to 100% success is noble, time-consuming, but leads to very clean, beautiful
    and optimised code.

    The challenge, however, is to code after the deadline, on a live system
    that's breaking under an unexpected user load. Reality is to code with
    people screaming at you down a phone line/skype session, demanding answers.
    The real challenge is providing those answers in a way that calms everyone
    involved, and simultaneously refactoring a month's worth of code in ten
    minutes in a way that does not result in messier code.

    Coding in a calm environment is easy, and very satisfying. It is, however,
    step one of one hundred. The other 99 step happens in chaos. The real
    challenge is to work as well in the chaos as in the calm.

    Brilliant Post! and I agree with everything you've put as I seem to do much

    @adriaan\_pelzer:

    Um, no. I've been programming professionally for over thirty years, and what
    your describing is not "the real challenge". That's like saying the real
    challenge for a surgeon would be to do a liver transplant in an emergency
    room- that's not a challenge, it's professional negligence. If you want
    quality work, you give professionals respect, and isolate them so that they
    can do the job without interruptions. If your reality is the one you
    describe, you should find another employer, or, if you are so inclined,
    start your own company.

    Programming is a deeply cognitive activity, requiring great stretches of
    uninterrupted thinking. It is one of the most difficult activities a human
    brain can do, and yet some companies still pack their software engineers
    into a single room like sardines in a can, require them to waste time
    attending meetings, and require them to pair up with each other. Pair
    programming might make them feel less lonely, since it turns programming
    into a social activity, but ALL of the peer-reviewed research that I've read
    confirms that it only really has benefits for student programmers, not
    professionals with experience. But some companies buy into the hype, instead
    of the research.

    Randall:

    What a great post. How you program is very similar to the way I write blog
    posts. Isolated and ruthless.

    I learned about the Pomodoro technique from @sivers. He wrote that there's
    something about hearing the faint tick of the timer that keeps you focused.
    He's right. I use it for writing only, and I associate that sound with full
    immersion in my work. I set the timer for 1 hour periods, and I do several
    hours back to back. I write on my calendar each day how many hours I've
    worked like this - it's become a very important metric for me.

    I liked reading about how you're just not yourself around other people. I
    feel the same way, so it's comforting to know I'm not the only one.

    Great post!\

    Quite the insightful post, I really enjoyed it. Although I'm not as ruthless

    of losing track of time while creating an engine...that wasn't really
    needed. :P

    On another note, I did enjoy the sudo rm -rf pic as well! I've never traced
    something before, but I figured I should try it out and use inkscape at
    least once, so here's a vector traced image in 1440x900 on that pic :D\

    One thing I like to do when I code is write something, such as a function or
    a class or whatever the case may be, and then leave it for a few days. Don't
    look at it. Don't even put it into my project. Then when I feel the time is
    right, I go back and look at it. Sometimes I think to myself, "What was I
    thinking?!", and other times I think, "Damn, I'm good".

    I also like to modularize my project and break it into milestones. That way
    it doesn't feel overwhelming and you get a great sense of accomplishment
    when you complete a milestone.

    Great post, I agree with some of them however I strongly disagree with
    others.

    In some way I can understand what you mean with "that you do your best work
    when by yourself without distractions". And for some parts I think that is
    true even for me. But personally I find it hard to motivate myself to write
    AAA code when coding "for and by myself" I need a group of people that I'm
    working together with in a team in order to not get lazy when it comes to
    coding. I too do my best work when I'm not distracted and can fully dive
    into a problem and care deeply about solving it. However I can't get into
    that mental state by myself - I need other people to get there.

    So I need to work with other people in order to be an awesome programmer.
    Otherwise I get sloppy, messy and take shortcuts. Yeah, I know, I am lazy by
    heart, but I never let co-workers down :)

    Felt there was room for another point of view in this thread. Finding
    "creative freedom" when working alone is nice, but creative inspiration and
    experimentation stands for just a tiny bit of the work when something needs
    to be done and finished. The rest is just HARD WORK. And why does code
    sometimes move "off a tangent" in the first place? Is it because you want to
    be creative and find the most nerdy solution, or maybe it's just because you
    like working alone and doesn't communicate with other people about what
    actually needs to be done - and how. But I TOTALLY agree on the sloppiness
    point. There's never an excuse to being sloppy, even not when working in a
    team.

    MrPeterPod (Twitter) responded:

    I agree with you about removing all distractions as it really does help, but
    the reality is that you can't remove them all the time. I work in an office
    and am always getting colleagues asking "just a quick question" which then
    spreads out into 30 minutes. The real test is managing to block out
    everything around you so you can get stuff done and sit within a noisy
    environment.

    There are occasions though when I've had no distractions all day and do
    nothing but write code. When those times come they feel amazing! Things just
    flow beautifully and time flies.

    danny77uk (Twitter) responded:

    Very insightful post! (found via CodeProject).

    Do you also write project documentation? I work on several personal projects
    and these days I write detailed requirement documents and then post-mortem
    analysis documents on what I discovered. Its odd because NO ONE is going to
    read them but me but it helps avoid snow-balling and it keeps the projects
    structured. And it's nice to be able to tick off actual completed
    objectives.

    In regard to working in isolation, it sounds like you may have social
    anxiety. Like you I find working with people draining in general. However,
    if you're lucky enough to work with like-minded people, or really advanced
    developers, you can spark ideas off of each other and learn new things.

    One thing I'll caution against though is attempting to attain perfection.
    Software isn't perfect. You're goal, either at work or at home, is to
    accomplish a task, to make a program work. Writing clean, well-documented
    code is laudable, but spending time on anything that doesn't really help
    achieve the task is wasteful.

    Ruthlessly re-factoring old, but working code is generally a waste of time.
    Changing the style of existing code to conform to the latest styling whims
    is a waste of time. Changing existing non-managed code to use managed
    pointers etc is a waste of time. Writing your own container class, or XML
    parser because the existing 3rd party library's API is poor is a waste of
    time.

    Apply best practices to new code only.

    I only emphasise this because my hard drives are littered with unfinished
    projects because I spent all my time worrying about unimportant things or
    trying to write perfect code. When you look back at projects you wrote a
    year ago, you'll forgot about all the time you spent on that stuff. Only the
    result will matter.

    At war with reality responded:

    Achieving greatness in coding, or really anything, is not possible unless
    your goals are great. You must imagine optimality. You must be a visionary.
    But it must also be implementable, it must be technically feasible. Finding
    such things is hard. Implementing usually is the easy part.

    But the hardest part for many is giving up basically everything else in your
    life in pursuing them. If you don't feel like giving up everything else,
    your goals aren't great enough. If they are, it's not just easy, you know
    it's the only option.

    Can you imagine spending 5, 10, 15, 20, 30 years on a project (with
    innumerable sub-projects) - to the exclusion of everything else? That's what
    true, world-changing making-a-dent-in-the-universe greatness may require.
    It's your so-called-life vs greatness.

    In the end, you don't choose to be great. You become great by necessity.

    billioncore responded:

    On isolation

    When I came across the tabs as separate processes in the Chrome browser, I
    thought "Why not...? Why not extend this to EVERYTHING?"

    Indeed, why not make everything that's possible to isolate (usually a class
    or even a function or something simpler) run as a separate process, not just
    multithreaded?

    Sure, you run into all kinds of problems with parallelism, and it's not the
    most efficient thing if you're thinking of running on just one core, but
    your code utilizes all the cores when it works, and if a process crashes or
    doesn't return what you expect it to, no problem, the rest of the program
    keeps running.

    The process list sure looks different: you'll see tens, hundreds or even
    thousands of processes getting spawned when required and destroying
    themselves after they're done, or waiting patiently to be fed something to
    do.

    Call me crazy but I think this is the future.

    Hey Randall,

    Cool article. I think that you expose some programming mental techniques to
    get stuff done. I believe this could work really well for independent and
    isolated development time, but I don't think this works at all for company
    and team environments. When you are working on a medium to large or even
    some small projects that require more than 3 team members, and projects that
    need to comply with company policies, client business and technical
    requirements, budget and timeline, this approach becomes unusable. I
    sometimes wish it could be like this on projects, but in reality it never
    comes to happen. Just my 2 cents. Cheers!

    Charles Tolman responded:

    Interesting post. A lot of what you mention is about setting up and cleaning
    the "space" in which a programmer does work, whether it be physical space (&
    quiet) hence the isolation and elimination, or mental/software space i.e.
    being ruthless. Then you have just got the foundation on which you can do
    the real work which is a whole other layer.

    With regard to what I have learnt over my own 30years coding is that like
    Adriaan Pelzer said, learning the skill of keeping yourself calm while
    having customers, salesman or god forbid, managers, losing their heads, is
    THE skill I have learnt. This is what allows you to keep your mental space
    clear regardless of the external state. Not easy.

    And yes I still take myself away and isolate away from the core business
    sometimes, but it must be done in planned way. I actually think that some
    agile ideas may be counter-productive in this area. Though I do like a lot
    of what agile has to say.

    As ever, if there is anything to learn from this whole business: Rarely is
    anything simple. Most of it is about managing complexity.\
    Thanks for the post.

    Great post! Very inspiring!

    I loved the idea of moving everything off your desk and your monitor - it
    really helps to concentrate on your code when there is nothing to distract
    you.

    However, I don't quite agree with the idea of being alone. I feel that I
    perform better when I have someone by my side. I tend to write clearer,
    better code when I know that someone is going to see it RIGHT NOW. I also
    like to be able to exchange ideas and get immediate feedback. It comes very
    handy when I work on complex tasks.

    (But this is just my personal opinion - your mileage may vary. :) )

    Happy coding!

    That said, you have to be able to interact with others prior to coding
    (especially when you are working complex tasks), not so much for help, but
    so that you know how to make your stuff integrate well with their shit.
    Especially if your personal design decisions could have impacts on their
    design and leave you with buggy, sloppy mess, or a whole lot of unnecessary
    work when you go to integrate with their code base. But once you are done
    with that, back to headphones!

    Good stuff on your blog.
