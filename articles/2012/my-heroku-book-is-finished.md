### My Heroku Book is Finished

September 10 2012, 10:00 AM  by Randall Degges

![][]

I wrote [a book][] on Heroku! It's called **The Heroku Hacker's Guide**, and you
can buy it (right now!) in both e-book (PDF) and paperback formats on the new
book website: [http://www.theherokuhackersguide.com/][].

If you've read my blog, you know I tend to talk a lot about web applications,
infrastructure, and best practices. My real passion as a developer (and startup
guy) has always been building things. I love creating new products, services,
and APIs. I love working on open source code. And I *really* love deploying my
code to simple platforms that encourage me to write good code, and allow me to
grow my applications as I please.

Since first using [Heroku][], I've been incredibly impressed over and over again
by their product, service, and culture. Not only has it been incredibly simple
and straightforward to deploy my web applications on Heroku's platform--it has
been *enjoyable*.

Over my years working on and building web applications, I've done all sorts of
devops work. I've built continuous integration and deployment systems. I've
written [puppet][] modules to bootstrap software services. I've spent time
writing [Rackspace][] and [EC2][] auto-provisioning scripts that boot new
servers and kickstart software configurations. I've learned how to automatically
load balance incoming HTTP requests. All in all, I've spent thousands of hours
building fail-safe web services.

But I can tell you now that the *single most effective thing* I ever did to free
up my time and let me do what I love (build things) was to start using Heroku.

In my opinion, Heroku has gotten things right. They've built a
platform-as-a-service company that encourages [best practices][] development,
and gives you all the tools and transparency you need to deploy amazing software
that people love. Outside their product, Heroku is filled with amazing people
doing amazing things. They actively build and release open source software (look
at their [GitHub account][]), they hire [amazing][] [people][] that build
[amazing][1] [things][], and they genuinely care about their users.

My new book, [The Heroku Hacker's Guide][a book], aims to be a practical guide
to using and *understanding* Heroku's platform, from the ground up. Regardless
of what programming language or web frameworks you use, if you're serious about
deploying your web applications to the best platform around, and want to master
your toolset, this book is for you.

If you'd like to buy the book (or learn more about it), you can do so
here: [http://www.theherokuhackersguide.com/][].

Thanks for reading.

    \$5 a bit pricey for a 66 page guide.

    I feel cheated.

    Would be nice to see a TOC and PAYPAL as payment method.

    Seems to be a great book!

    I'd like to have PAYPAL too :D

    @Toblerone sorry you don't like it! I'd be happy to give you a refund (just
    send me your email address so I can look you up).

    Toblerone, does this book contain too much fluff? If so, ask for a refund.
    If not, the book should cost much more than \$5. K&R's C Programming
    Language, a book known for having little fluff, currently sells for nearly
    \$50 at Amazon and has fewer than 300 pages.

    I bought the Heroku book, and if it doesn't have much fluff, I'm going to
    buy it again because \$5 wouldn't be a fair price.

    Altons responded:

    100% agree with Josh B. - Any meal in one of the well-known fast-food chains
    is about \$5 so this book at \$10 still cheap. Also if you follow Randall's
    blog you already know this guy knows what he's talking about.

    Still waiting for paypal option though ;-)

    Randall Degges responded:

    Sorry about the paypal stuff guys :) I have a proposal though. Instead of
    paying me with paypal, you can simply donate some money to the ASPCA:
    [http://aspca.org/][], they help abused animals (my favorite charity).

    Just shoot me an email: [rdegges@gmail.com][] and I'll send you a free copy
    of the ebook in return.

    Thanks for all of your support!

    I also agree with Josh B. Pages are not important. Content is important.

    Chris Benson responded:

    Randall,

    While I enthusiastically applaud your desire to help animals in need, the
    ASPCA has a terrible record of doing so. The ASPCA is a big supporter of
    animal control kill policies.

    I'd like to suggest sending donations to the non-profit No-Kill Advocacy
    Center, which is the national leader in advocating no-kill practices at
    shelters. They're focused on saving animal lives, rather than killing
    animals that have become inconvenient to their animal control shelters.

    While I support the aims of the No Kill Advocacy Center, I have no
    affiliation with them. Thanks for tolerating my 'rant', and I hope you'll
    consider this option.

    Hi Randall,

    I am Yohei, a freelance developer in Japan.\
    I am really interested in this book and would like to buy it. \
    But it seems I can't use my Japanese credit card to buy the ebook at
    Gumroad.

    Well, is there any way to get the ebook?\
    I sent you an email, so I am very happy if you reply me.

    Bought it. Its a quick read, but well worth the \$10! I learned a few new
    things that I can instantly start implementing, making it well-worth it. It
    also made me appreciate New Relic more, and long for the day when I can
    afford New Relic Professional.

    Hi Randall, i Enjoyed the book. I have two questions:

    ​1) In 15.2 are you advocating creating three heroku apps and combining them
    into one webapp? Can you explain more about what you mean/ how this would
    work?

    ​2) I'm trying to build a free webapp and so i'll just be using the dev plan
    for both my staging and production application, can you suggest anything i
    might do to make this more manageable? Is there anything i should be aware
    of or wary of? Thanks in advance.

    Randall Degges responded:

    Hi @drew!

    ​1) Yep! This is the basic way Service Oriented Architecture works. I've
    written a few posts on the topic that will explain in a lot more depth, here
    are the links:

    - [http://rdegges.com/service-oriented-side-effects][]\
    - [http://rdegges.com/service-oriented-problems][]

    ​2) Well, Heroku's free tier is the same quality as their paid tier. So you
    don't need to worry about doing anything special to make sure things run
    smoothly. The only thing to keep an eye on is your addon usage. For
    instance, if your application needs addons (postgresql, redis, etc.)--look
    at their pricing tiers closely, as you may have to upgrade them to larger
    sizes if your application outgrows the free plan.

    Hope that helps!
