### Dangerous People

There are lots of people on earth--some big, some small, some famous, some
unrecognizable, and some *dangerous*.

Out of all the people I can think of, the most dangerous ones are the pragmatic
ones. That guy (or gal) you know through IRC who's always working on his side
projects well past 2am each night--*these* are the most dangerous people. They
posess skill sets and personality traits that aren't commonly seen: they're
reasonable, thoughtful, passionate about what they do, and not afraid to do it
(even if it takes a lot of work).

Almost everything is done virtually today. Each day the physical world seems to
slip a bit further into history, and the virtual world seems to replace the
crumbling buildings it leaves behind. We've all seen how incredibly fast
technology has replaced century-old businesses, and there is no question in my
mind that within the next 20 years the trend will continue.

If you're a computer programmer, engineer, graphic designer, or any combination
of the above, you're in an incredibly unique position right now: you have the
ability, tools, and power to build immense wealth, influence, and fame--much
moreso than at any previous time in history.

With a laptop, an internet connection, and 50\$ you can bootstrap even the most
abitious technical projects *by yourself*, decimating even the most highly
established, well-funded and successful businesses in an incredibly small amount
of time.

It's time to take your skills, and use them to your advantage. Instead of
putting in 60 hour weeks at a company you hate, it's time to bust out of your
shell and unleash your power and ability. Don't hesitate, and don't hold back.
The timing couldn't be more perfect, so don't let this opportunity go to waste.

If you've got the skills, ambition, and motivation to build something great, get
out there and do it. **Be dangerous**, now is the time.
