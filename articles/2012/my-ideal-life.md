### My Ideal Life

January 18 2012, 9:32 PM  by Randall Degges

![][]

As a strong believer in personal development, I realize that I will never be
perfect. Despite this, a big part of the fun in life is working towards making
yourself a better person. If you don't do that, what else is there?

In order to make yourself a better person, knowing which traits you'd like to
eventually have is essential. Maybe you're a smoker, but you'd like to
eventually quit. Maybe you're skinny, and want to add 10lbs of muscle to your
frame. Regardless of your personal development strategy, knowing what to work
towards is mandatory.

Over the past year, I've come to realize the importance of having [positive
habits][], and how building a series of habits into your daily schedule is one
of the best ways to make long term, sustainable change.

As my life goals are still undefined, my current focus is on building
a repertoire of habits and skills so that over time, I'll gradually become the
person I'd like to be, with as little friction as possible.

For the past few days I've been trying to enumerate the skills I want to have,
and the life I want to live. After a lot of thought and personal debate, I've
narrowed my ideal life down to the following 24 hour snapshot. My thought is
that if I'm able to spend each day doing the things below, I'll be both happy
and wildly productive throughout my life.

**ALSO**: I'm absolutely positive that I'm going to continuously change my mind
about this over time. The points below represent my thinking at this current
moment only. Future self, if you're reading this: what are you up to? Have your
goals changed? Your ideal life?

In a given 24 hour day, I'd like to spend:

-   **10 hours sleeping.** This includes buffer time, stuff like brushing teeth
    and sliding into bed. This way, I'll get a minimum of 8 hours of sleep (with
    2 hours of buffer in there, just incase).
-   **1 hour writing.** Writing is a tool I'm quickly becoming more and more
    fond of. Writing has helped me learn things in much greater depth, as well
    as improve my communication skills. I highly value communication skills, so
    this is high on my list of importance.
-   **1 hour reading.** I do a lot of reading, and I plan to continue this.
    Reading books, in particular, has taught me innumerable lessons, and the
    value I receive for my time investment is overwhelming.
-   **1 hour exercising.** Having a strong body is important--not only for
    longevity, but for mental health and mood. Hitting the gym everyday and
    lifting weights would be a great way to stay in top condition year round.
-   **3 hours eating.** This means uninterrupted meal and relaxation time either
    by myself, or with my family and friends. Rushing through meals is
    unsatisfying, and eating slow seems like a healthy, relaxing routine.
-   **1 hour hacking on an open source project.** This means writing code that
    goes straight back to the community. Not only do open source projects build
    programming skill, but they're extremely fun, and provide a great way to
    meet other smart, talented people.
-   **2 hours working.** This would ideally be hacking on my own company in some
    form: giving direction, writing code, whatever. Just working on a meaningful
    project that provides real value in the world, and enough money so that I
    don't have to worry about it.
-   **5 hours doing anything else.** This includes watching TV, hanging out with
    my wife, attending events, showering, volunteering, whatever.

Why so little work? Well, it's my thought that by improving myself in all areas
(including things that aren't quantifiable--like focus, willpower, etc.), I'll
be able to accomplish a lot more by working both smarter, and with more focus.

Working smarter means only doing things that absolutely require my personal
attention. By putting myself in a position where I can outsource all but the
most essential functions to others, I'll be able to drastically cut down my
daily todo list, leaving me with much less (but more important) work to be done.

By working with more focus, I mean that over time, I'd like to build up my focus
to a point where I'm able to completely immerse myself in a task for hours on
end, without breaking concentration. Having that sort of intense focusing power
would allow me to accomplish a great amount of work in a very small amount of
time.

I believe that if I'm eventually able to work both smarter and with more focus,
than 2 hours should be more than enough time to make a difference at work.

For the extra 5 hours of random time each day, I'd like to use that to do
meaningful things. Maybe work on other projects, volunteer my time for a worthy
cause, etc. It would also be nice to have free time so that, even on bad days, I
can just lay down for a large chunk of the day and not feel guilty. After all,
this is supposed to be a sustainable schedule--something that I can live with
over a long period of time, not just a short term thing. This could also be a
great way to throw myself at whatever I'm feeling most passionate about that
particular day. This would free me up to spend an extra few hours working if I'm
really in the mood, or maybe an extra couple hours reading--who knows.

So, that's my ideal life in a nutshell. What's your ideal life (or day) look
like?

    That is not working, and will not work from the beginning, because the time
    is something very subjective for everything, also time and space dont
    exists, they're simply made from humans from their perspective ...

    I think it's a sound schedule, but only if you are your own boss. You can
    even do this when you're sick (unless in coma) and when you travel. It seems
    with this schedule one would actually spend less time being sick and more
    time traveling.

    Right now for me it looks like this: 6 hours sleeping, 1 hour writing, 2
    hours reading, 15 minutes exercising (I do the same routine every day
    though), 2 hours cooking and eating, 0 hours hacking on open source project
    (this has to be fixed asap), 8 hours working and the rest is random stuff
    (usually whatever's my wife up to.)

    Now, on weekend and holidays, I might not be working or working less than 8
    hours, which adds to time for random stuff.

    @Ivan Yah definitely. Won't work with traditional employment. In regards to
    your schedule--that's pretty intense. How do you live with only 6 hours of
    sleep?

    Also: how long have you been maintaining it? Seems like a lot of work to be
    doing everyday :o

    Sounds like you must be insanely productive though.

    Ivan responded:

    @Randall I end up taking naps or sleeping in on weekends to cover some sleep
    deficit. I've been doing it for only a few weeks and I think I'll be getting
    back to normal 7-8 hour sleep.

    As for the productivity, it seems like I do as much as I did working 6
    hours/day but I have a better salary now. I'm planning on switching back to
    part time to spend more time on my consulting job and finally get involved
    with an open source project.

    You make a good point of working less but with a better focus. Do you have
    any statistics to back it up?

    Randall Degges responded:

    @Ivan I'm really interested to see how your self-experiment works out. You
    have an email? I'd love to keep in touch :o

    Anyhow, in regards to the focus stuff, all the science I've read about it is
    related to the Pomodoro Technique. Here's a great book on it:
    [http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1934356506/ref=as\_li\_ss\_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=proje...][]

    Basically, you break your time up into 25 minute chunks of intense focus on
    a single task, with absolutely no outside interruptions. People who have
    done this are shown to greatly improve their performance, focusing ability
    (over time), and their ability to relax (by clearly defining work times).

    Thanks for the comment!

    Personal goals and self-development (\<-\>

    Here is the most important insight I have come to conclude;\
    - Do whatever feels right, right now.

    I hit the gym regularly, every day before heading for work. It has become a
    morning ritual and I feel more alert after the gym than when I don't
    excersize...but, in periods, I feel to tired or don't really feel like it.
    If I resist and excersize anyway - I actually enter an unproductive period
    which goes on for a couple of weeks.

    I have reading-periods as well. When commuting to work, which is about half
    an hour, it's truly rewarding to read and follow the intended thoughts of
    the author. But, right now, instead of reading I am in a period
    of...haha...watching tech-talks on youtube via iPad. This has shown to be
    quite stimulating for me and in once sense; I have started thinking in way
    of thoughts I like...really. It has been giving me a
    "kick-in-the-ass-and-break-the-pattern-you-are-in" feeling I have longed
    for.

    So...when doing things but not feel like I must - is the way (at least for
    me).

    Finally, I would like to suggest to you (if you're not already familiar with
    it) NLP (Neuro Linguistic Programming). I promise, it's not a tech-thing, on
    the contrary...NLP can be practised towards other people or yourself. I have
    learned/learning it to better understand others as well as myself and
    communicate better with the next person. In my opinion, I have become even
    more empathic, thanks to it.

    Ok...this is how it is; I have allways been intressted in psychology but
    also seen it as a quasi science. As any other programmer, I learn fastest
    with trial and error methodology. This approach can not be implemented in
    psychology since it takes to long start and end a "try" - and then make
    intelligent conclusion based on the try. The results I have gotten from NLP
    is much faster and it has really been an important tool for me...during my
    personal development (which IMHO actually never ends).

    There is so much to say about NLP and my personal experience is positive.
    Who knows, you might like it as well :)

    Randall Degges responded:

    @Hakan Bilgin thanks for the comment. I'm going to check out NLP--never
    heard of it before.

    Also: in regards to doing what feels right--that's definitely a good idea. I
    know that with me (reading in particular), I often switch it up between
    reading a physical book (or KIndle), and doing the whole audiobook or ted
    talk thing. I'll count any of those towards my daily reading goal regardless
    of the medium.

    Thanks again for the recommendation :)

    I set a lot of goals for myself. I used to accomplish less than half of them
    because I wasn't approaching them in the right way. The goals I set weren't
    always clear and I couldn't keep track of everything. I found this [online
    organizer][] a couple of months ago and it has made all the difference. I
    can now easily follow the plans I make, and the plans themselves are now
    clear. It's awesome.

    Here's a funny thing: I also asserted that I had to take action and make a
    schedule that consists primarily of things that will help me achieve
    progress over my goals (I'm 30 years old and I'm refreshing my programming
    skills to change my career) but I wanted to do it in a fluid way; that is
    without neglecting my health, physical condition and social life.

    Within the first few paragraphs you managed to capture my worries in the
    last few months. The problem that I face isn't with distractions but keeping
    it strict (saying X hours for this and Y for that doesn't work for me). So
    instead I placed deadlines. I note down that the following week I need to
    finish reading this book, complete this app, learn this, install that and
    then just note them down in a to-do list for the week. Then I figure out an
    approach that works per day (again without defining how much time it will
    take me to do something).

    Then again, I'm still in the second (or third?) month of working my way
    through the days with a schedule and I might consider to keep tabs with
    timing myself, starting this March.

    Hi Randall, I am also a firm believer of self improvement and I am very
    excited to have found a blog and a person like you! Interestingly, I am 24
    years old (similar age to yours), I am also in my way to define many things
    and improve the performance of all tasks I do everyday. The objective
    function is simple: happiness (understanding that this is a dynamic state,
    it gets high and low all the time).\
    In a normal day, I invest my time working for 8 hours, sleeping for 8 hours,
    exercising for 2 hours, reading for 2 hours, eat for 2 hours and I use the
    last 2 in anything else (videogames, hacking my android, arduino... etc).
    However, I feel I am not arranging my time in the best way, so right now I
    have decided to change this (This idea has been in my mind from several
    weeks ago :), but your inspirational post has impulsed my desire to change!!
    ).\
    I will be following you. In the next days I will be writing very much about
    it, hope I can share it with you, If you are interested. Bye!

    @Juan David Dude, that's awesome. I'd love to see your stuff. Do you
    maintain a blog or anything I could follow along with? If not, send me an
    email so we can stay in touch: [rdegges@gmail.com][]. I \_\_love\_\_ talking
    and reading about this sort thing.

    It's definitely easier to make changes when you have other people to keep
    you going and motivated :)
