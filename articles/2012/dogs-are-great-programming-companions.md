### Dogs Are Great Programming Companions

I love dogs. Really. They're the best beasts on the planet.

For those of you who don't know: I work at home with my chihuaha, Scribbles.
She's an awesome programming companion. As I work she lays in her dog bed next
to my desk, and naps while I code. When I stand up and move around, she chases
me around the house, and gets me to take her outside for a walk.

Since I started working at home two years ago, I've realized how great a dog can
really be while you work. For me, Scribbles keeps me balanced. When I'm feeling
stressed, I can lean down and scratch her head. If I've been sitting too long,
Scribbles will get my attention and demand a walk. She always knows exactly what
to do to keep me sane, day after day.

When I'm working on particularly complex software problems, I'll often talk out
loud to her, explaining my thinking and proposed solution. Half the time, just
the act of forcing myself to talk to her, explaining myself, helps me realize
problems in my thinking.

In addition to the benefits of having a funny looking animal around at all
times: knowing you've got some unconditional love no more than 2 feet away is a
nice reminder life is good. Even when I'm working really hard to fix critical
problems, or in the zone coding away, having a dog nearby makes me feel
comfortable and happy.

Here are some pictures of Scribbles (the destroyer of worlds), in all her glory:

**NOTE**: Incase you're wondering--she's named Scribbles because she has
scribbled markings all over her coat.
