### Asterisk 1.6 AGI C Library Project

December 19 2009, 8:00 PM  by Randall Degges

I’m announcing my Asterisk 1.6 C AGI library for developers [(cAGI)][]. cAGI is
a fully compliant Asterisk 1.6 AGI library for C developers. It can be used in
production (I’ve been using it on several production boxes for the past 5
months), and has been generally well tested.

cAGI was originally part of my [WildPBX][] project, but I’ve decided to release
it as an individual project to help speed up development, and loosely couple the
entire WildPBX project.

Currently, I’m cleaning up the cAGI code base, and building a good Makefile for
installing the library (so that the includes can be used from anywhere). It will
be ready soon, I promise!

Stay tuned for more updates :)

    that can get in love's way. How is that - you may wonder?\
     Consider the thought that...
